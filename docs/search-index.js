Where you use this symbol to mean either (as in and/or), do not surround it with spaces. Use the % symbol, not the word percent. If you are compelled to spell it out for some reason then note that both percent and per cent are acceptable — but let’s favour percent, to be consistent. Use numerals, except in these cases in prose where you should use words: Where you use a common expression (one or two of them; three’s company). Where you start a sentence with a number (Twenty Land Raiders? That’s a lot of firepower!). Where you state a simple fraction (one half; two thirds). Ordinals one through nine (first; ninth); thereafter, use the numeral with 'st', 'nd', 'rd' or 'th' as appropriate, in superscript (8th army; 41st millennium; 33rd regiment). In general prose, you can use contractions 'k' (thousands), 'm' (millions) and 'bn' (billions) for items and money — but only with numerals, and never for people or distances. * When you use a contraction, place it next to the numeral (no space). For units, use the appropriate abbreviations or symbols in most cases (10 cm, not 10 centimetres). And in general, use a space to separate these from the numeral just as you would for the full term. Some exceptions where you should not use a space include: ° (degrees); °C (degrees Centigrade) \" (inches) % (percent) Note that the plural of an abbreviated unit is the same as the singular (25 cm, not 25 cms). Example 1. Contractions and units two billion of the Emperor’s subjects, not two bn 4,200 km, not 4.2k km 22.5 MB, not 22.5MB 7bn credits, not 7 bn credits For decimal values of less than 1, always include the leading '0' (0.3, not .3). For numerals over 999, insert commas for clarity (1,000; 2,500,000). Use to in number ranges, or use en dash if you must –, not hyphen - or em dash — (8 to 12 vehicles; 8–12 vehicles). Example 2. More examples for numbers We fired 7,043 rounds of ammunition There are three million barrels of fuel at stake — or, There are 3m barrels of fuel at stake There are 7 million people in that one hive city A quarter of a million Guardsmen At a cost of 10bn credits The first wave of the attack The 11th planet in the system Two-thirds of the enemy’s total strength On average, five D6 rolls that require a 4+ result will yield 2.5 hits Before an acronym, let pronunciation be your guide: an SHT (ess-aytch-tee), not a SHT; a CCW (see-see-double-yoo), not an CCW. Before a silent h use 'an' (it’s an honest mistake) but where the h is pronounced use 'a' (we found a heretic). Use abbreviations with care. Don’t take it for granted that all readers are familiar with an abbreviation. Do give the full expansion the first time you use the term in a topic. If you will use the abbreviation of the term later in the topic, then first put it in brackets immediately after the full expansion. A super-heavy tank (SHT) is a fearsome machine. It’s common for several SHTs to work together…​ Don’t use an unfamiliar abbreviation if it won’t be used again in the text. Don’t use an abbreviation as a verb (Use SHWs against prime targets, not SHW prime targets). Don’t include full stops in abbreviations. Don’t use an apostrophe to pluralise abbreviations unless the abbreviation ends in an s (the titan destroyed two SHTs; Epic 40,000 was published in the late 1990s). See also abbreviations. We define an acronym as a set of initial letters of words, which we then pronounce as a word (PIN; NASA). We define an initialism as a set of initial letters of words, which we do not pronounce as a word (SHT; GW). In general, you should use upper case for both acronyms and initialisms. But note the common exceptions: Where an acronym is used as a proper name then you may capitalise just the first letter, to avoid an excess of capital letters (Nasa). But in general, aim to follow whatever convention the organisation itself uses. Some words that started out as acronyms are now treated as orthodox nouns (as with laser). Take extra care with a and an before an acronym or initialism (see a; an). Asciidoc includes five built-in admonition types: NOTE; TIP; IMPORTANT; CAUTION; WARNING. We define our usage in this project at How to use this publication. Learn about the markup at Admonitions. We also use custom admonitions, based on the built-in types. You can only use these with the block markup — you can’t use them with the inline markup. For 'Epic 40,000 difference' notes, use footnotes in the form footnote:[{e40k-diff}]. When you mean to refer to an early product release in prose, use upper case. This is an ALPHA release. Don’t use This is in ALPHA. Do not place spaces around the forward slash. Use your judgement here. Words like allows, needs, offers and permits are anthropomorphic, but generally acceptable. See Anthropomorphism. Also, choose your words such that you don’t conflate things that the player does or that happen as game effects with things that happen 'in universe'. Use the normal possessive ending ('s) after singular words or names that end in s (Warboss’s retinue; Saint Scythus’s fame), and after plurals that do not end in s (Gretchin’s; Eldar’s; Guardsmen’s). Use the ending s' on plurals that end in s (the Orks' warlike nature; the Warbosses' armies converged. Do not insert apostrophes into decades or centuries (the 1990s; the 2000s). Asciidoc includes 'sidebar' markup that is suitable to hold content that is an 'aside' from the main content. We define our usage in this project at How to use this publication. Sometimes an aside is a better fit than an admonition. Either way, don’t overdo it. Learn about the markup at Sidebars. Asciidoc includes markup that you can use to apply a title to a block element. We haven’t fully defined our usage yet, but in general: Use a block title to provide clarity or sub-structure where the content doesn’t warrant a full heading (and built-in anchor). Learn about the markup at Add a Title to a Block. Aside from Asciidoc markup, use brackets in the content as follows: Default to round brackets ( ) for most use cases. Where you use them for parenthesis, try to do this only at the end of a sentence, or — where appropriate — consider em dashes instead, as in this sentence. Use square brackets [ ] where you need to insert a comment or clarification as an editor. You will also need to type an empty attribute in front, such as {blank}, to 'escape' them from the normal Asciidoc processing (you could use + at each end, but this will escape everything inside, so then URLs and such won’t work either). Avoid curly brackets { }, except where you have a special use case — and then you’ll need to escape them in the same way as for square brackets. If you introduce the list with a lead-in sentence, end that sentence with a colon. If the bullets are a continuation of a lead-in sentence like this, then: ensure that each bullet is a single sentence, with no full stops ensure that every sentence makes sense as a continuation of the lead-in sentence do not capitalise the first word of each bullet (unless it is a proper noun or acronym of course, as usual) do not add a full stop or other punctuation at the end of any sentence — not even to the last one if you really need to create a sentence with more than one (related) clause then use a semi-colon or an em dash — but don’t overdo it If the bullets are not a continuation of a lead-in sentence, write the sentences or paragraphs as normal. See also steps (ordered lists). Cannon as a plural is a bit archaic and can appear odd, as in this statement: Distortion cannon bore an unstable warp hole in the fabric of reality. — Epic 40,000 Rule Book So, use cannon for the singular and cannons for plural. Do capitalise Proper nouns (people, places, names, brands): Ancient Terra; the Imperium of Man. Titles of publications. See also citations. Names of computer languages, protocols and reference standards: File Transfer Protocol. Special keywords in this project, when you use them in their special sense: Keywords for special abilities and super-heavy weapons, such as Death Ray. Though in most cases, in the Asciidoc source, you should use a defined attribute which outputs with the correct capitalisation and formatting anyway (in this case, you’d type {death-ray} to invoke the correct attribute). Unit characteristics, such as Firepower value and Damage Capacity value. Unit types, such as War Engine unit. The correct way to pluralise a keyword like War Engine is to add the correct plural noun: War Engine units, not War Engines. Do not capitalise Compass directions and derivations (north, east, south and west; southern Necromunda; the north-western wastelands) — unless they form part of an actual or implied proper name for a region. Expansions of initialisms, except where the expansion includes words that we would normally capitalise anyway: super-heavy tank (SHT), not Super-Heavy Tank (SHT). Terms that also happen to be special keywords, when we don’t use them as such: The Space Marines put up a stubborn resistance, not The Space Marines put up a Stubborn resistance. Terms that can have a particular meaning in the rules, but which do not act as special keywords: detachment; unit type; unit. Take extra care with terms that can have a particular meaning, to avoid ambiguity in the rules — don’t mix terms like 'detachment' and 'unit', and don’t use synonyms like 'formation'. Do not use UPPER CASE for emphasis. In the absence of other guidance for a particular case, give citations in the following format: , , . For example: Path of the Eldar, White Dwarf, issue 214. Use the same words and capitalisation as in the target publication. Some contractions are okay, as we don’t want to sound too formal — such as they’ve, we’ll, can’t and don’t. Avoid others like should’ve, could’ve and would’ve, and don’t use incorrect perversions of these contractions such as should of or coulda. Similarly, avoid they’re — or at least use the correct homophone for the context (they’re/their/there). There’s no one 'right way', but here are some good conventions: For a long date format, use {day name in full} {day number, with ordinals} {month in full} {year, four digits} with no commas and no 'of' (Monday 3rd of September 2020). For a short date format, use {day number, two digits}-{month number, two digits}-{year number, four digits} (22-09-2019). Or, use the reverse order format when the 'sort order' is important or when there may be confusion with the US 'month first' date format (2019-09-22). For 12-hour format, always use a colon and am or pm — no full stops, and no spaces (6:30am). For 24-hour format, omit the colon, always use the leading zero for the single-digit hours, and append 'h' (0630h). These rules help to avoid the doubt that can arise from 12:30 or 1230. Use midnight and midday — not 12pm, noon, 12 noon. For a range of time, use the word to — or failing that, use an en dash as stated at Numbers. In prose, avoid abbreviation of dates. If abbreviations are necessary because of space limitations, then use the common three/four letter abbreviations (Mon; Thur; Jan; Sept). Example 3. Dates and times Long form: Monday 4th of September 2020 from 10:30am to 12:30pm. Shorter form: Mon 04 Sept 2020, 10:30am–12:30pm. Shortest form: 2020-09-04 1030h–1230h. Dice = plural of die. Die = singular of dice. Use the correct form — just because some manufacturers can’t seem to get it right doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t! These are contractions of 'electronic '. Do not hyphenate everyday examples like email and ebook — and do not insert needless capital letters (eBook). Capitalise as normal if you mean the proper noun, and not if you don’t (None now remember Earth as it was; just a mess of earth and craters. A contraction of a Latin term that we use to mean for example or such as. Lower case. No stops. However, avoid this term and use plain English instead. If you really must use it for some reason, then use it at the start of a new sentence or parenthesis, with a comma. Eg, like this or (eg, like this). Do not confuse with ie, which has a different meaning. Use bold styling for emphasis, not UPPER CASE or italics. If you must use this abbreviation of the Latin term then do not end it with a full stop (unless it is at the end of a sentence of course!) — but see etcetera. A Latin term that we use to mean and so on. However, avoid this term and use plain English instead. Better yet, consider whether you can make a more concise and complete statement rather than leave the reader with questions about what the 'other stuff' you allude to might be. Farther refers to length or distance — it is the comparative form of the word 'far'. Use this word in relation to physical distance. Further can mean 'to a greater degree', 'additional', or 'also', in reference to time, amount or continuation. Use this word for metaphorical or figurative distance or degree. Avoid continuations with this word — use 'also' or consider whether you can make a simpler sentence. Where the focus in on a particular file extension, use the monospace/code text format, precede with a full stop, and type the extension in lower case unless this is not usual (Check the names of all .pdf files in the list). Where the focus is on the actual file format itself, or on the type of file in general, type the abbreviation in its standard form — usually upper case (use the JPEG format for photos; PDF files are good for archival). If the extension/format/type is unusual and likely to be unfamiliar to the reader, introduce it at the first mention in much the same way as for initialisms — or even with a short explanation if it is important. See Topic titles and topic file names. Writers often use 'fire' as a synonym for 'shoot'. Needless variation can lead to ambiguity, so be consistent and use 'shoot' throughout the rules. Outside of the rules context, it is okay to use 'fire' where it is a more 'natural' match for your prose. Use only standard capitalisation, also known as sentence case. Never use title case or full upper case for headings. Get some tips on how to construct good headings at Titles and headings. It can be tricky to use hyperlinks well in documentation. Get some tips at Write effective hyperlinks. Hyphenate two-part words where it makes sense to separate repeated vowels (co-operate; pre-eminent; pre-empt; re-entry). Do not use a hyphen where you should use a semi-colon, colon, em dash or en dash — each has its own purpose, so learn to use them as outlined in this guide. See also e-words. Be careful with words that end with ing, especially gerunds (that is, verb forms which function as nouns, such as 'shooting'). It is all too easy to use such words in ways that weaken the text and create more room for doubt. Use more descriptive verbs or more plain and powerful phrases instead. For more information, see Are -ing words really that bad?. Example 4. -ing words You measured, and then shot with the Vehicle unit, not You were measuring and shooting the Vehicle unit. Use a phrase like Shoot with a super-heavy weapon, not Shooting a super-heavy weapon (and not Shoot a super-heavy weapon either). Use a phrase like We plan to improve the shooting rules, not We are planning on improving the shooting rules. A contraction of a Latin term that we use to mean that is. No full stops. Lower case. Use it with a comma either side, ie, like this — or comma after in parenthesis (ie, like this). Do not confuse with eg, which has a different meaning. However, avoid this term and use plain English instead. The worldwide collection of networks that offer a number of services, one of which is the Web. In general, use lower case (internet access; internet service provider). It isn’t wrong to capitalise when you use the word as a proper noun — the Internet — but it can be tricky. Be consistent, and if you want to know more see When Should I Capitalise 'Internet'?. It’s is a contraction of it is. Its means belonging to, much like his and hers — no apostrophe. Its' is meaningless. Do not use italics for emphasis. Use italics to reference the title of an article, document or publication, or for defined keywords where appropriate. [TODO: Rationalise use of italics in this A to Z.] In general, avoid Latin terms and their contractions like etcetera, ad hoc, ie and eg. They may be obscure to some readers. Use plain English alternatives instead. Use UK English word choices and phrases — but avoid terms that can confuse readers who are more familiar with other varieties of English, or for whom English may not be their first language. That said, there is a difference between informative content such as rules, and entertainment content such as short stories. This style guide is mostly concerned with standards for informative content, to make the rules as clear as possible. For entertainment content, it is okay to add interest through a more varied use of UK English, just as Games Workshop does. There are no plans to translate this project into other languages or to adapt it to other locales. See also spelling. Log in = verb. Login = noun. (To log in, enter your username and password in the login form; If you’ve forgotten your login details, contact support) none = pronoun that means not one or not any (they checked the floor for dice, but there were none). non- = a prefix that we add to a term to mean not or the opposite of that term (non-human; non-functional). See Numbers. Upper case. Okay is also acceptable. Lower case. open source = noun (this software is open source). open-source = adjective (open-source software). Don’t use open-sourced as an adjective. One word, no hyphen. One word, no hyphen. See Numbers. operating system. Don’t use O-S or O/S or O.S. Note that Apple devices use iOS or MacOS, and Google Android-based devices use Android OS. Do not use passive case, except where there really is no better way — which there usually is unless you have a specific need to be vague about agency. Instead, use the active case, usually in the imperative, and in the first or second person. It should always be clear who or what is the 'actor' in the sentence. For rules, assume that the reader is the primary actor even though they might actually read the rules to check what their opponent may or may not do. Example 5. Active case, not passive case First person: We will release, not It will be released. Second person, imperative: Check that there are no dice on the floor, not It is recommended that the player checks underfoot for dice. Second person as the primary actor: When you shoot with this weapon, not When a player shoots with this weapon. See % (percent). plugin = noun, as in a software component that extends functionality (I like the flow chart plugin). plug in = phrasal verb. Avoid phrasal verbs, and use a clearer alternative (plug your charger into your phone, not plug in your charger). Don’t use an apostrophe to pluralise an abbreviation — unless the abbreviation ends with an s. Even then, it is often better to add the appropriate plural noun (Automated SOS messages, not Automated SOS’s). See also abbreviations. For the possessive on a plural, see [apostrophes]. practice = noun (with regular practice, the rules become easy to remember). practise = verb (you can practise a variety of tactics). In brief: Use double quote marks only to quote passages of text or actual speech; use single quote marks for unusual phrases. Double quote marks in more detail Use double quote marks to quote passages of text or direct speech (Wazdagga said \"Oi, wossat over dere\"). If the quote is a full sentence, place terminal punctuation — such as a full stop — before the closing mark. Otherwise, punctuate after the closing mark. When you start a new paragraph within a quote, close the paragraph with terminal punctuation only (such as a full stop) — skip the closing double quote mark, but start the new paragraph with an opening mark. For long or engaging quotes, consider Blockquotes. Single quotes in more detail When you refer to events and unusual phrases, use only single quotes. setup = noun (Terrain setup). set up = verb (Set up the terrain). Don’t hyphenate. Use modern UK English spellings. So: immobilised, not immobilized; colour, not color. See also localisation and internationalisation. Do not use double spaces after a full stop or other punctuation — this became redundant when computers and proportional fonts replaced typewriters and monospace fonts. Use only a single space. Use steps to guide a reader through a process. Use alphanumeric sequences, not bullets. Use a lead-in or stem sentence where appropriate, but try to structure the content so that it is not necessary. Punctuate each step normally, to include a full stop at the end of each step. If you need to include a sub-sequence within a step, use indented lowercase letters. Like this. And like this. If you need to provide choices or points in which the order is unimportant, use indented bullets (unordered list). Like this. And like this. And then continue with the next step like this. See also bullets (unordered lists). Two words, hyphenated. See Titles and headings and Topic titles and topic file names. Either is acceptable, but favour towards as it is more common in UK English. Check the spelling and capitalisation of trademarks and brands, and use them correctly. Do not use a trademark as a verb (search for it, not google it). Symbols like ™ and ® can be useful where appropriate, but don’t overdo it — on the first mention should be enough in most cases. Hyphenate when you use the term like an adjective to describe the operative noun, but not when you use it as the focus of a statement (we always use the up-to-date version; the publication is up to date). See Numbers. uniform resource indicator. There is a technical difference between URL and URI, but URL is in common use even where URI would be more accurate. Favour URL except where the distinction is important. See also hyperlinks (usage). uniform resource locator. See also hyperlinks (usage). A Latin term that we use to mean against or perhaps compared with. Commonly abbreviated to vs. However, it is usually better to avoid this term and use plain English instead. See versus. When you use the word as a modifier, use lower case and separate words (web address; web page; web application; web services). However, it is usual to write some terms as single words: website; webcam; webmaster; webcast. If you refer to the Web, capitalise as you would for any other pronoun — and by extension, capitalise concepts like Web 2.0. Note that 'the Web' is not interchangeable with 'the Internet' — the Web (formally, the World Wide Web) depends upon the Internet, but the reverse is not true. Use while to convey activities that happen in parallel. Use whilst to acknowledge opposing or contrasting viewpoints. (My opponent gritted his teeth while I rolled my dice; Whilst I do like enamel paint, I much prefer acrylic)","title":"A to Z of style","component":"contributors-guide","version":"","name":"a-to-z-of-style","url":"/contributors-guide/a-to-z-of-style.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Symbols","hash":"_symbols","id":2},{"text":"& (ampersand)","hash":"_ampersand","id":3},{"text":"/ (forward slash)","hash":"_forward_slash","id":4},{"text":"% (percent)","hash":"symbols_percent","id":5},{"text":"Numbers","hash":"numbers","id":6},{"text":"0 to 10, and beyond","hash":"digits","id":7},{"text":"Numerals or words?","hash":"_numerals_or_words","id":8},{"text":"Contractions and units","hash":"_contractions_and_units","id":9},{"text":"Other rules for numbers","hash":"_other_rules_for_numbers","id":10},{"text":"A","hash":"_a","id":11},{"text":"a;

In combination with other software, it facilitates truly collaborative writing through a 'docs as code' approach. Flexible re-use of content, to minimise errors and inconsistencies in content that we want to repeat in identical or very similar tracts. Easy, robust cross-referencing and redirection of links when we need to change the address of a web page. Flexibility to allow people from outside the project team to use a web interface to view the source content and to suggest edits directly.

So, everyone can see what is going on and authors can compare versions and roll back mistakes if they need to. The repositories do not contain the outputs in their final form.

This is partly because such projects don’t scale well, given the inherent complexity and the typical tools and processes that are in use: 'More collaborators' doesn’t always equate to 'faster and better progress'. Yes, collaboration is great in principle, because you share effort and pool ideas and expertise. But in practice, collaboration also makes it even harder to keep track of work, to ensure consistency and to reach agreement. Feedback from the wider community is hard to get and to track in a way that makes it easy to discuss and act upon.

This means that we intend to: Make the rules easier to understand and use. Fix some gaps and problems in the rules. Update and extend the army lists. Add some new special abilities. Offer some optional rules and other extras. However, we have a principle that we intend to keep at the forefront at all times: That is, to respect and retain the distinct nature of the Epic 40,000 game system — we want to present the Epic 40,000 system of gameplay at its best, not create a derivative with substantial differences in gameplay. See below for more detail on these goals. Our intent is for Epic Remastered rules content to be clearer and more user-friendly than in Epic 40,000, while we keep the gameplay almost entirely the same. I say 'almost' because the original Epic 40,000 publications present some rules in ways that are confusing, contradictory, ambiguous, or even a bit 'broken' — and to fix this we must sometimes challenge common misinterpretations or, in rare cases, actually change the gameplay slightly. So, we rewrite the rules to make them easier to understand and use — clearer, better structured, more consistent, less ambiguous, and much easier to navigate and use on a mobile device too. Where we do create actual gameplay differences, we go out of our way to include footnotes to highlight and explain these. If you disagree at any point…​ well, of course no-one’s stopping you from playing it your way instead! (We’re also open to suggestions if you have a better way or you think we’ve overlooked something.) Intellectual property rights We must respect the intellectual property rights of Games Workshop plc. A thorough rewrite should also mean that we don’t infringe upon copyrights, as we’ve created a new artistic expression. (And of course we intend no challenge to the status of trademarks.) We mean to fix inconsistencies and gaps that exist in the original lists, and to extend the lists. We don’t want to extend the army lists just the sake of it, but rather to: Add some variety and character that was lacking in the original. Add some forces that Games Workshop didn’t invent until much later, but which now have a well-established place in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Many enthusiasts enjoy these newer forces and wish to use them with Epic Remastered. Compatibility of old Epic 40,000 army lists with Epic Remastered If you really want to for some reason, there’s nothing to stop you from using the original Epic 40,000 army lists with the Epic Remastered rules. There are some minor differences in terminology, and where Epic 40,000 defines some army-specific rules in its army lists, we’ve rationalised and redefined these in the Special abilities section instead — but that’s about all that you’ll need to adjust to. Our philosophy for existing special abilities is much the same as with the rules of play — we’re just rationalising things. However, we’re also adding some new abilities that help us to extend the army lists and gameplay in interesting ways. To be clear, when we refer to Epic 40,000 we usually mean the entire set of publications — not only the books and other materials that were in the original Epic 40,000 boxed set that Games Workshop released in 1997, but also various updates that they published later, mainly in the Firepower magazine series and the Epic 40,000 Magazine series.","title":"About this publication","component":"core","version":"","name":"about-this-publication","url":"/core/about-this-publication.html","titles":[{"text":"Improving the rules content","hash":"_improving_the_rules_content","id":1},{"text":"Improving the army lists","hash":"_improving_the_army_lists","id":2},{"text":"Adding to the special abilities","hash":"_adding_to_the_special_abilities","id":3},{"text":"Source materials","hash":"_source_materials","id":4}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"ER Drop Pods tokens (PDF) [1] 1.

Then you’ll be able to use your mobile device to consult the rules even when you have no Internet access.

(And it’s awkward to use on-screen too.) However, when the project reaches a suitable level of maturity and stability then we can consider a PDF output for those who really want it. We’re hopeful that by that time we’ll have the tools to publish to PDF much more easily than we can at present. 1.

Epic Remastered is by fans, for fans, and open to the community as a collaborative effort. Date of this build: 2025-06-07 This project is now well under way, but we still have lots to do. We’re not yet ready to treat any part of the project as 'stable' — we treat all content as 'draft' and subject to change at any moment. So, we don’t spend the time to document the changes (except at a high level as occasional updates in the Facebook group — see Discussion). Important features are likely to change without notice. Styling is minimal. The content components in this project are as follows: Main project Core: The main body of the project, principally the core rules of play. This component is now functionally complete, but there are still improvements we’d like to make and details to attend to. Among other things, we need to create and add graphics and images — especially where explanatory examples are concerned. Battles: Additional rules for setup and play. First drafts are in progress in this component, but there are a number of empty placeholder topics at present. Armies: Guidance on how to choose and build your armies, along with army lists that detail detachments, unit data sheets and points costs. There is almost no content in this component at present — but fear not, you’ll find army lists in the interactive Detachment Builder. Contributor’s Guide: Guidance for contributors, to help with governance and consistency, and to document our methods in a transparent way. You’ll also find links to the game content components in the main navigation menu. You can switch between all main project components at the component menu (at the bottom of the secondary navigation panel). Also important to the project, but held in different repositories and hosting: Detachment Builder Epic Remastered Detachment Builder: A convenient way to choose your army online and to print out your detachments and unit data sheets. Ian Wood continues to adapt and extend this from the open source 'Army Forge' software to suit our needs, and to populate it with new and revised content. We intend to mirror the Detachment Builder content in the Armies component eventually. You’ll also find a link in the main navigation menu at Resources Detachment Builder.

Lunr supports some special search functions that you can use to refine your search. We explain some of these here. By default, Lunr includes variations on stem words in its results. Example 1. Stem words and their variations shoot will yield not only instances of the stem word 'shoot' but also variations such as 'shoots', 'shooter' and 'shooting'. This works in combination with most other search functions. Many search tools support exact match searches, usually through the use of double quotation marks (\"ork\"). However, at the time of writing, Lunr does not support exact match search. You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard, anywhere in your search term. Example 2. Trailing wildcard search sho* will yield instances of words that begin with 'sho', such as 'shoot' and 'should'. Example 3. Leading wildcard search *oot will yield instances of words that end with 'oot', such as 'shoot' and 'boot'. According to the Lunr documentation leading wildcards \"…should be used sparingly. They can have a negative impact on the performance of a search, especially in large indexes.\" Example 4. Middle wildcard search s*t will yield instances of words that begin with 's' and end with 't', such as 'shoot' and 'silent'. By default, Lunr will search both the content of topics and the titles of topics. If you want to find matches only in titles, you can use the title: prefix. Example 5. Titles-only search title:shoot will yield only instances of 'shoot' that appear in topic titles — it will not yield instances that appear elsewhere in the content. You can combine titles-only search with other search functions and multiple terms. Example 6. Titles-only search with other functions and terms title:sho* fire will yield instances where a word in a topic title begins with 'sho', or where the word 'fire' appears anywhere in the content. You can of course enter multiple terms into the search box at one time. By default, Lunr will combine your terms together with the logical operator OR — and thus you’ll get results that match any or all of the terms you entered. Example 7. Term presence search — default behaviour with multiple terms ork gun will yield instances where either 'ork' or 'gun' exist, or both exist. (Effectively 'ork OR gun'.) However, you can change the behaviour for each term that you enter. You can define which terms you want to be present or absent to match results: To indicate that a term must be present, prefix the term with a plus (+) character. To indicate that a term must be absent, prefix the term with a minus (-) character. Example 8. Term presence search — 'must', 'may' and 'must not' behaviour +ork gun -trukk will yield instances that must contain 'ork', may contain 'gun' and must not contain 'trukk'. (Effectively 'ork AND/OR gun NOT trukk'.) Example 9. Term presence search — 'must' behaviour to simulate AND +ork +gun will simulate a logical operator AND search — that is, it will yield only results that contain both 'ork' and 'gun'. (Effectively 'ork AND gun'.) Fuzzy matching can be helpful where you’re not sure how to spell a word, or you want to expand your search to include more 'close' matches in your search results. To use this, append a tilde (~) and then a positive integer to a term. The positive integer defines the 'edit distance'. An edit distance of 1 will match words that differ from your search term by only one character. That is, words that would match your search term if you were to add, remove or change a single character, or to transpose a single pair of characters. Example 10. Fuzzy-match search ork~1 will yield instances of words that are within one edit of 'ork' — such as 'Mork' or 'ark'. This search would not return matches for 'stork' as that would require two edits, to add an 's' and a 't'. When you search for multiple terms, it may be that some terms are more important to you than others — that is, results where these terms have a more significant presence are likely to be more relevant to you. For such cases, you can 'boost' the relevance of particular terms. This makes Lunr treat those terms with more significance — any topic that matches a boosted term will get a higher relevance score, and appear higher up in the search results. To apply a boost to a term, append a caret (^) and then a positive integer. Example 11. Boosted search — single boosted term shoot broken^10 will score the term 'broken' 10 times higher than the term 'shoot'. So, Lunr will prioritise results that include the word 'broken' ahead of those that contain the word 'shoot'. The boost value can be any positive integer, and you can give different boosts to different terms if you like: Example 12.

If you’re an avid tabletop wargame enthusiast then you’ll have most of this already. Otherwise…​ you might have to borrow, buy or make some of these things. And, welcome to the addictive world of wargames! Play for fun, don’t sweat the losses and may all your games be jolly and entertaining! An opponent! Epic Remastered is primarily a two-player game, with no solo-play rules. Two armies of 'Epic scale' miniatures to represent the Warhammer 40,000 factions that you and your opponent wish to play. 'Epic scale' is nominally 6 mm or 1:285 scale, but varies somewhat in practice. A suitable wargames table to serve as your battlefield. The 'default' size for Epic games is 180 cm by 120 cm (~6' by 4'). Miniature terrain/scenery to make your battlefield visually appealing and tactically interesting. You don’t always need these, but they can be useful to make notes and reminders during the course of a game. You might also use a pencil and paper-based method to design and record the details of your army between games. [TODO: Add something about paper rosters/detachment cards and digital alternatives, especially the Epic Remastered Detachment Builder.] You’ll need to measure distances a lot in the game. A pair of trusty retractable measuring tapes are ideal. You’ll want ones that have centimetres (cm) marked on them. Ordinary six-sided dice. Wargamers can never have too many, but 20 or 30 is plenty. You can manage with pencil and paper, but it’s nice to have some markers that you can use to track damage (and shields) on some of the larger engines of war in the game. You might consider: Dice of a different size, colour and/or number of faces to your handfuls of ordinary dice. 'Damage tracker' or 'wound' dials — available from many manufacturers, in a range of styles. You need various visual markers, templates and other aids to track particular effects in the game. You need markers to identify the specific orders that you choose for your detachments, and for conditions that are in effect. (As we explain at Orders and conditions.) Original Order markers The original markers that Games Workshop produced for the Epic 40,000 and Battlefleet Gothic games are ideal if you can obtain enough of them (10 or 12 should be enough to play a typical game). These green six-sided Order markers have a different symbol on each face, and are also known as 'Order dice' for obvious reasons (although we do not use them like dice). You may be able to source these from the likes of the eBay website — although they can be expensive as they’ve been out of production for a long time. Alternative Order markers More likely, you’ll need to obtain or create alternatives. Some ideas: The marbled grey six-sided Order markers that exist for the 2016 Adeptus Titanicus game are just as good as the originals, as their symbols are almost identical. 3D-printable alternatives exist online, both in six-sided form or as individual tokens for each symbol. If you don’t have access to a 3D printer, there are retailers who sell the physical items. Make your own! Even cardboard squares with text on them will suffice. [TODO: Add explanation.] These are simply circles of card with a diameter of 60 mm — originally with colourful artwork to represent explosions. We recommend that you have three. Most of the time you need only one, but there are some rare cases where it is helpful to have more at hand. The original Epic 40,000 boxed game included nice printed airfields, to help players to keep track of the readiness of their Flyer units. These are merely 'nice to have' and are only effective for a small number of flyers anyway. The main thing is to have a convenient way to keep track of which out-of-play Flyer units are in which state of readiness: Repair; Rearm; Ready. Depending on the nature of the battle that you intend to play in a given session, you may need some of these accessories. You’ll need this only when you use the Army Morale rules. [TODO: Add explanation.] You’ll need these only when you use the Objectives rules. The original Epic 40,000 boxed game included a set of full-colour cardboard objective markers. These had the name of the objective type on one side and a suitable corresponding graphic on the other. You could easily create something similar. Or, it’s even better if you create small scenic items to represent them — it is much more visually satisfying to battle over a miniature bunker or fuel dump than over a cardboard marker! Just be sure that it’s clear what objective type each scenic item represents. [TODO: Ideally, in due course we’ll add suitable designs to a downloadable 'print your own play aids' file.] You’ll need these only when you use the Hidden Setup rules. A set of cardboard or plastic markers will do, so long as each marker has a unique number to identify it. Eight or ten of these markers will be plenty for most games. If your numbered markers are small scenic items that represent clusters of foxholes and booby-traps, then so much the better for the visual effect! You’ll need these only when you use the Drop Pods rules. For print-your-own tokens, see Downloads → Drop Pods tokens. You’ll need these only when you use the Fortifications rules. [TODO: Add explanation.] [TODO: Add explanation, and link to new Fate cards content when it is ready.] We don’t have Remastered versions yet. However, the original Epic 40,000 Fate cards remain useable. So, feel free to use them if you have them, or print your own — you can get redrawn versions at Epic 40,000 Compendium → Further resources.

The ability to strike ground targets at will without risk of interception by enemy fighters will take its toll on your opponent’s forces. You’ll foil their plans while you gain more freedom to act. You may be able to gain this supremacy by destruction of enemy aircraft through aerial combat and anti-aircraft attacks from ground-based units. But why not hit enemy air forces when they are at their most vulnerable — while they are on the ground! Send your flyers on a ground attack against the enemy airbase! This is our version of the Counter-strike mission that appeared in the Air Superiority article which Games Workshop published in both Firepower, issue 1, and White Dwarf, issue 214. The article offered the mission as 'optional' rules that you must agree with your opponent — neither fully 'official', nor 'experimental'. [TODO: This seems like a bit of an oddity. Consider whether to make this mission fully part of the Remastered rules, or to pursue another alternative.] We might need to rework this rule quite a lot — in its current form it seems like it may unbalance the game too much. Perhaps the overall idea would work better as a special scenario that we could use in a campaign, rather than as a 'regular' flyer mission. You must declare each Flyer detachment that you wish to perform this mission at the appropriate step in the Start phase. [TODO: Presumably, we resolve Counter-strike in the Movement phase, but we should make it explicit. We should also integrate and state all the steps in full, rather than just allude to similarities with the Ground Attack rules.] Your opponent may be able to 'scramble' some of their flyers before you complete your attack — that is, at least some may get airborne so that your strike does not catch them on the ground. Flyers in the Ready state Where your opponent has declared a mission for Ready Flyer units, these are already airborne. [TODO: Do we need to state something to the effect that flyers that are on a mission do not enter the Repair or Rearm states until after any Counter-strikes are resolved?] Where your opponent has Flyer units in the Ready state, but not declared for a mission, these units automatically scramble to get airborne. [TODO: Presumably, these flyers will be Ready again next turn?] Flyers in the Rearm state Your opponent may roll a D6 for each such unit: If the score is equal to or less than the unit’s Intercept value then it successfully scrambles to get airborne. If the score is greater than their Intercept value then they do not scramble and your strike will catch them on the ground. Flyers in the Repair state These units cannot scramble to get airborne and so your strike will catch them on the ground. Resolve the Counter-strike attack just as you would for a Ground Attack mission — though note the following: For the sake of clarity, if your opponent has flyers on Intercept orders then they can intercept your Counter-strike flyers just as they can for other missions. Your opponent may also resolve one Snap Fire attack against each of your Counter-strike flyers, to represent the anti-aircraft defences of their airbase. Treat all the enemy flyers that you catch on the ground as a single vehicle detachment in the open. We assume that all of your units are in range for their attack. As there are no 'nearest models' among the units that you catch on the ground, allocate hits to them however you like. Where your attacking units have the Barrage or Heavy Barrage ability, these contribute 2 or 4 Firepower each, respectively. There is no chance that a Flyer unit on the ground will be 'driven off' — a hit will always cause damage, just as it does with non-Flyer units. [TODO: Consider a separate topic or partial to cover the whole 'treat flyers that are on the ground/landed just like other ground units' aspect.] As usual for target Flyer detachments, do not place Blast markers for this attack.

When play passes to you in the Movement phase, place all of the Ready units in the detachment at any point along any edge of the playing area. You must place them so that they all face in the same direction. This is where they will start their attack run. Flyers have an unlimited move, but you can only move them in the direction that they face when you place them. So, you must move all Flyer units that are in the same detachment in parallel courses, in formation. Enemy units can Snap Fire at them as they move — but in contrast to ground units, Snap Fire does not halt the movement of Flyer units. You may halt movement of Flyer units at any point — halt them all at the same time. Make ranged attacks with the Flyer units, just like you would with ground units in the Shooting phase — use the Firepower values of the Flyer units and any super-heavy weapons that they have. But note: You can draw a line of fire only where an enemy unit lies within range and inside the forward 90° arc of your Flyer unit. Ignore any intervening terrain though, as it is far below the altitude of the flyers. Otherwise, the attack works just like a normal shooting attack — so for example,as long as you meet the other requirements then you may split fire between multiple target detachments.

Immediately I presume, but might there be any reason to allow players to do it later in the phase if they prefer in some cases?] While your Transport (X) Flyer units are landed, they are subject to the same game effects as ground units. This means that, for example: Your opponent may use artillery on Preparatory Bombardment orders to shoot at them in the Movement phase, before they can disengage. There is no chance that a flyer on the ground will be 'driven off' — a hit will always cause damage, just as it does with non-Flyer units.

If you leave no units behind, remove all Blast markers from the detachment with no penalty.

This can be an effective method to deploy reserve forces at the optimum time and place. Well-known examples include Necron portals and Eldar Webway portals. The rules that govern how we use the Portal ability to transport units are very similar to those for the Transport (X) ability. However, there are some important differences. Where we include Portal on a unit data sheet — or for an objective — we also include some further information, as attributes in brackets. For example, like this: Portal (INF, 4+, Walker, Auto). Mostly, these attributes indicate what other friendly units can actually pass through the portal — that is, which kinds of unit that portal permits you to embark and/or disembark as 'cargo' units during the game. (INF): Permits Infantry units as cargo. (4+): Permits Vehicle units that have an Armour value of 4+ or lower as cargo. (Walker): Permits Vehicle units that have the Walker ability as cargo, regardless of their Armour value. We also indicate how the portal affects the arrival of detachments that you intend to use with it, through the (Roll) or (Auto) attributes. See Portal Reserves for more about this. We use (Roll) and (Auto) to represent different technologies for different factions. They are mutually exclusive, for both thematic and practical reasons — so all Portal units in a given army list are of one type, never a mix of both. Where your army includes any units or objectives that have the Portal ability: Regardless of the scenario, you may keep some detachments out of the play area, as Portal Reserves. You may do this with any number of your detachments that contain units that your Portal units permit as cargo. Don’t get carried away — if you have many Portal Reserves detachments out of play and few suitable Portal units in play then you’re in for a hard time! Where your unit or objective has the Portal ability and is in play: You can use this unit to move Portal Reserves detachments into play after they arrive. See Portal Reserves. You can use this unit to move detachments that are in play from this portal to another portal that is in play, or from another portal that is in play to this portal. See Use a Portal unit to move your forces. You can use portals to move some of your forces around. Where you wish to move one of your detachments into or out of a portal, and it contains permitted cargo units: You may do this only in the Movement phase, and only if you give the detachment Advance or Assault orders. Embark and disembark cargo units in the same way as for the Transport (X) ability. See Transportation by Transport (X) units. [2] [3] You may use each individual portal only once per turn, to embark or disembark units from a single detachment. Any portal that you use becomes unavailable until the start of the next turn. You may embark a permitted cargo unit that is already in the play area into an available portal — but you must immediately disembark the unit from a different available portal elsewhere in the play area. [4] These Portal Reserves rules are a special variation on the standard Reserves rules. The difference is in the detail of how detachments that you set aside as Portal Reserves will arrive, and how you put them into play. You can put Portal Reserves detachments into play only by means of Portal units. The type of portal that your army can include determines how detachments that you keep aside as Portal Reserves will arrive: Where your army has (Roll) portals, roll on the Reserve Detachment Arrival table for your portal reserves detachments in the Start phase — just as you do for standard Reserves. Where your army has (Auto) portals, do not roll on the Reserve Detachment Arrival table for your Portal Reserves detachments in the Start phase — instead, they always arrive in turn 2. Either way, once a Portal Reserves detachment arrives, you must put it into play if possible, in the Movement phase. This can be tricky. To put a Portal Reserves detachment into play after it arrives, you need an available portal — and some units can only use particular portals that permit their transit. If there is no portal available when you need it, then you must leave the detachment in Portal Reserves this turn — it does not arrive yet after all.* If none of the available portals can disembark all of the units in the detachment, then you may choose either: Leave the detachment in Portal Reserves this turn — it does not arrive yet after all.* Disembark as much of the detachment as you can. The units that cannot disembark count as destroyed for the purposes of Army Morale and victory conditions. Place a Blast marker on the detachment. *If you leave the detachment in Portal Reserves, then: If your army uses (Roll) portals, then you must roll on the Reserve Detachment Arrival table again next turn. If your army uses (Auto) portals, then you must try again next turn. If the detachment does not arrive and enter play before all Portal units/objectives in your army are destroyed or the game ends, then the detachment counts as destroyed for the purposes of Army Morale and victory conditions. [5] [6] To complete the move of units that you can put into play, obey the rules at Use a Portal unit to move your forces. Example 1. Necron Portals You have a Necron army which includes, among other things, two different Portal units: A Monolith WE unit — which has Portal (INF, 4+, Auto). A Warbarque WE unit — which has Portal (INF, Walker, 4+, Auto). Your army also includes two detachments that you decide to keep outside of the play area, as Portal Reserves: Detachment A, which contains some Necron Warriors (INF), Lokhust Destroyers (INF), and Tomb Blades (VEH with Armour 4+). Detachment B, which contains some Necron Immortals (INF), Canoptek Spyders (VEH with Walker), and a C’Tan Shard (VEH with Walker). As the portals in the Necron army list are (Auto) portals, detachments A and B will both arrive in turn 2. When they arrive, you can use detachments A and B with the Portal units as follows: All of the units in detachment A can pass through either portal. So, you can use either Portal unit to disembark detachment A, provided the portal is available. The Walker units in detachment B can pass through only the Warbarque’s portal. So, you must either: Use the Warbarque Portal unit to disembark this detachment, provided the portal is available. Use the Monolith Portal unit to disembark this detachment, provided the portal is available — but in this case, the Canoptek Spyders and the C’Tan Shard are destroyed and you must place a Blast marker on the Immortals units that form what’s left of the detachment.

When you disembark cargo units from an objective that has the Portal ability, you obviously cannot pay 5 cm of its movement like you would with a mobile transport unit. In this case, just deduct 5 cm from the movement of each cargo unit that you disembark, as usual, and ignore the deduction that would normally apply to the transport unit. 3. When you disembark units that you’re bringing into play from Portal Reserves, treat them as already embarked — so you only pay the 5 cm cost to disembark. 4. To be clear, there is no option to use a portal to transfer units out of the play area during the game. 5. If you’re playing a scenario that uses the Army Morale rules, deduct the detachment’s Morale value from your current Army Morale value, as normal for a destroyed detachment. 6. We consider the detachment to be 'destroyed' for the sake of the battle, but not for the war.

This is similar to how Damage Capacity works with War Engine units. That said…​ Units that have the Robust ability are not War Engine units — do not apply the War Engine rules to them. In brief, it takes two hits to destroy a Robust unit, and each Robust unit counts as two normal units for both hit allocation and detachment strength. We’re testing this ability as a way to make some units tougher than the standard rules allow, but not as tough as War Engine units. Candidates for this ability include Space Marine Land Raiders, Ork Stompas, and Chaos Greater Daemons. Where your unit has the Robust ability: The unit starts the game with Damage Capacity 2. When you calculate the detachment strength, count the unit as equal to its remaining Damage Capacity. Each hit reduces its Damage Capacity by one point. If the unit’s Damage Capacity is reduced to 0 then it is destroyed. Where you attack a detachment that includes units that have the Robust ability: Each Robust unit counts as either one or two units for hit allocation, according to the number of Damage Capacity points it has left. This means that when you allocate hit dice and you reach a Robust unit, you must allocate two dice if it is undamaged or one die if it is damaged. Then continue to allocate dice to more distant targets in the usual way. Where possible, all dice that you allocate to a Robust unit must score equal to or higher than its Armour value, or all dice that you allocate must score lower. The aim of this restriction is to force the attacker to destroy the unit or bypass it, and so to minimise the need to track units that have only one remaining point of Damage Capacity. You may not allocate a further hit die to the unit until you have first allocated hit dice to all eligible units, in the usual way. Any hit that would automatically cause critical damage against a War Engine unit, such as a hit from a Death Ray weapon, causes an extra point of damage instead against a Robust unit. In other words, a single hit from such a weapon will always destroy a Robust unit outright. A Robust unit counts as one unit for all other purposes, such as 'ganging up' and hit rolls in close combat, supporting a close combat, and to determine the number of units that are under a Barrage template. Example 1. Robust ability and detachment strength Consider a Space Marine detachment like this: Units Number of units Detachment strength 1x Captain 1 1 6x Land Raider (with the Robust ability) 6 12 5x Terminator squad 5 5 Total 12 18 Although the actual number of units is only 12, the Robust ability of the Land Raiders means that the effective detachment strength is 18. So, at the outset of the battle you will benefit from a +1 modifier for Leadership tests. The detachment will be at half strength when its number of normal units and remaining Damage Capacity totals nine or less. Example 2. Robust ability and allocation of shooting hits You shoot your detachment of Orks at a Space Marines detachment that includes Terminator (Armour 5+) and Land Raider (Armour 6+) units. Figure 1. Robust ability and allocation of shooting hits. The green rectangle is a detachment of Orks. The blue rectangles are Space Marine Terminator units. The Blue circles are Land Raider units that have the Robust ability. Your dice rolls yield six results of 5 or more — so you have six hit dice to allocate. Allocate a die to the nearest target unit, Terminator squad (1). The next nearest unit is Land Raider (1), which has the Robust ability — so allocate two dice to it. These must either both be results of 6 that can affect the Land Raider, or both be rolls of 5 that cannot affect the Land Raider. The next nearest units are Terminator squads (2) and (3), so allocate the fourth and fifth die to these. Finally, you must allocate your last die to the next nearest unit, which is Land Raider (2).

The original Epic 40,000 rules do not appear to allow this. The proposal Define charge move rules that allow you to move your War Engine unit into base contact with multiple enemy units.

Rather than stop there, you may continue to move the War Engine if it has more movement available. You must stop the move as soon as any of these events occur: The War Engine has run out of available movement.

Example 1. Assault moves and charge moves with a mixed Space Marine detachment You have a Space Marine detachment that is on Assault orders. Your detachment includes Space Marine, Assault and Bike units. You proceed to move this detachment in the Assault phase. The Space Marine unit has a Speed value of 10/20 cm. You can use the second value of 20 cm where you use the extra movement to make a charge move. That is, you may move your Space Marine units up to 20 cm where you use this to put them into base contact with an enemy unit; otherwise, you may only move them up to 10 cm. The Space Marine Assault unit has a split Speed value of 20/30 cm, as a result of the Jump Packs ability. You can use the second value of 30 cm where you use the extra movement to make a charge move. That is, you may move your Assault units up to 30 cm where you use this to put them into base contact with an enemy unit; otherwise, you may only move them up to 20 cm. The Space Marine Bike unit has a Speed value of 35 cm. As a Vehicle unit, you do not get a special increase to their Speed value for a charge move. That is, you can move your Bike units up to 35 cm, regardless of whether or not you put them into base contact with enemy units. Example 2. Charge moves with an Ork detachment You move the first three Ork Boyz units into contact with the blue Marines units. Then you move Ork Boyz (4), and you want to make base contact again. You could move them towards one of the blue Marines units, as you may put up to two units into contact with an enemy unit. Instead, you choose to ignore the blue Marines units that are already in contact with friendly units, and you move Ork Boyz (4) into base contact with yellow Marines (B). You cannot move Ork Boyz (4) into base contact with yellow Marines (A). This is because you would move them away from (past) Marines (B), who are closer than Marines (A). Example 3. Charge moves with an Ork detachment, with a more distant enemy unit You move Ork Boyz (5). You could move them into base contact with one of the Space Marines units where you have already placed Orks in base contact; or you may move them towards yellow Marines A, which is the nearest enemy that is not in base contact with a friendly unit. If you wanted to move Ork Boyz (5) towards towards the more distant yellow Marines (C), then you would have to end movement of Ork Boyz (5) at the point where they reach the red line. This is because any further movement towards yellow Marines (C) would be away from (past) yellow Marines (A). Why you might want to approach a more distant enemy unit You might ask why you would want to move Ork Boyz (5) towards yellow Marines (C). This could be for several reasons, such as: It puts Ork Boyz (5) within range of an objective, or in a better position for the next turn. It increases the likelihood that, if you win the close combat, you will destroy Space Marine units as they try to retreat. That is, because you put your Orks further forward, there is less room for your opponent to place their retreating Space Marines units such that they are at least 15 cm away from your units — and so you may destroy more of them. Of course, this also works against you if you lose the close combat…​ Where yellow Marines (C) is in a separate Detachment: You hope to win the close combat against the first Space Marine detachment, and then trigger a firefight with the detachment that includes yellow Marines (C). As you must have at least one unit within 15 cm to trigger the firefight, you move Ork Boyz (5) to meet this requirement.

Where you make an assault move that puts your unit in base contact with an enemy unit we call this a charge move. Every charge move is an assault move, but not every assault move is a charge move. Moves in the Assault phase are subject to all the rules that we described for the Movement phase — except that the Snap Fire rule does not apply in the Assault phase. Also, there are some complexities in this Assault phase that mean you need to pay extra attention to the way that you move each individual unit. [1] When you move a detachment in the Assault phase, move each of its units one after the other. For each unit: You must move it at least 5 cm — or into base contact with an enemy unit that is within 5 cm — if you are free to do so. [2] Any movement beyond this is optional. This move must be as direct as possible towards an enemy unit. This does not necessarily mean the nearest enemy unit, or even one that is in a detachment that you intend to assault. You may not move your unit away from the enemy unit that it is nearest to. You may ignore the nearest enemy unit if you already have a friendly unit in base contact with it. Then focus on the next nearest enemy unit that is not in contact with a friendly unit. You do not have to move units more than 5 cm if you do not want to. You might only want to move units into range for a firefight or to grab an objective, for example. Nearest enemy unit The nearest enemy unit is the one that your unit could reach by the shortest route. However, you may detour around dangerous terrain if you wish, to avoid Dangerous terrain tests. In that case, the nearest enemy unit is the one that your unit could reach by the shortest route that does not include dangerous terrain. [3] If the assault move that you make with a unit puts it into base contact with an enemy unit, then we call this a charge move, or a charge. This is the only time that you may move your unit into base contact with an enemy unit. You can benefit from a special increase to the Speed value of some units, but only where you use this increase to reach base contact — a charge move. Where a unit has a split Speed value such as 20/30 cm, use the second value. [4] For any other unit, use its Speed value in the usual way.

It represents a rate at which the unit can move across the battlefield and still be effective when it shoot its weapons. You can give units orders that allow you to move units farther than this, but their shooting will suffer. Some unit data sheets show a split Speed value such as 20/30 cm. Use the first value for all purposes, except where the rules tell you otherwise. For information about the second value, see Assault moves and charges. [1] Range The maximum effective distance of the unit’s weaponry (in centimetres). Firepower A value (usually a number) that represents the unit’s effectiveness when it shoots. A higher number is better. Some units are armed with super-heavy weapons that make special forms of attack. These units will usually have a word (such as Barrage or Macro-weapon) in place of their Firepower value. Assault This number shows how effective the unit is at close combat. We use this in the procedure to resolve an assault where units in one detachment charge an enemy detachment and the models are in base-to-base contact. In assaults the Space Marines' genetically enhanced bodies and superior training give them an advantage over Orks, so they have a higher Assault value. Armour This number shows how well protected and/or difficult to damage the unit is. Basically, you must roll this number or higher on a D6 to score a hit on the unit when you shoot at it. Both Space Marines and Orks are tough but the Space Marines' power armour makes them even tougher, so they have a higher Armour value. Notes If any special rules apply to the unit then we note this here. You’ll find explanations of the effects of these rules at Special rules. As you can see, the rules for Rapid Fire and Stubborn apply to Space Marines, whereas no special rules apply to Ork Boyz. 1.

Even so, most units in Epic Remastered are organised into groups with other units, for mutual support and co-ordination on the battlefield. We call these groups detachments. Some units, such as the Imperial Warlord Titan, do operate as wholly independent units; such units still comprise a detachment. Detachments represent forces that are detached from a larger organisation, such as from a company within a Space Marine chapter, or from an Ork clan within a Waaargh! (as Ork armies are known). Every detachment is led by a headquarters (HQ) unit which co-ordinates the actions of the detachment with others on the battlefield. Detachments are comprised of either Infantry and/or Vehicle units, War Engine units, or Flyer units. We detail the armies of various factions — and the detachments and units that you may field with them — at Armies. Within the restrictions of the particular army and detachment list you choose, you can tailor each of your detachments to include whatever number of units you like from the available selection.

The HQ unit must always be the most 'senior unit' that is present in the detachment, as indicated in the chain of command. If the original HQ unit is eliminated then the next most senior unit in the chain of command must take over. If several units are of equal seniority then you may choose which unit to use as the HQ from that point onward. Use a suitable marker or other device to keep track, so that both you and your opponent know which unit is the HQ unit at all times. As long as a unit is within 30 cm of its detachment HQ at the start of a phase then it is in command. If a unit is more than 30 cm away from its detachment HQ at the start of a phase — or if none of the units that remain in the detachment match a kind specified in the chain of command — then such units are out of command. We explain the phases at The turn sequence. For the moment, suffice to say that most movement happens in the Movement phase, most shooting happens in the Shooting phase, and so on. In command units can move and/or shoot in that phase, according to the orders you give to the detachment. Example 1. In command You have an Ork Mob detachment in your army. At the start of the Movement phase, all of the units in this detachment are within 30 cm of their HQ, so they are in command and you may move them all. Out of command units can not move or shoot in that phase, regardless of the orders you place for the detachment. You can still complete some actions with these units, such as: Snap Fire; fight or lend support in close combat; shoot in a firefight. (We explain these actions elsewhere in the rules, in the appropriate sections.) Check to see whether units are in command or not at the start of each phase, as the situation can change through your own mistakes or through casualties. Example 2. Out of command When you check at the start of the Shooting phase, you realise that you got a bit carried away earlier — two of your Ork Boyz units are now more than 30 cm away from their HQ, and so they are out of command. Though you may move and shoot as normal with the rest of the detachment, you may not do so with these two units until they are in command at the start of a future phase. In practice this means that you may not shoot with these units in the current Shooting phase. And, unless something unusual happens [1] , then you may not move these two units in the following Assault phase either. Aside from carelessness or certain unusual circumstances, you won’t often have units that are out of command. But when you do: Don’t place Blast markers on out of command units.

You don’t need a marker to indicate these orders, just so long as you can remember which detachments you’ve already activated under these orders in a given turn. Movement phase You may make a move with units in this detachment. Shooting phase You may shoot with the units in this detachment. Assault phase You may not move the units in this detachment. These orders allow a detachment to close with the enemy more quickly, at the cost of less effective shooting as they 'shoot from the hip'. Also, these are the only orders that allow your detachment to move into close combat with the enemy. Movement phase You may make a move with units in this detachment. Shooting phase You may shoot with the units in this detachment — but you must halve their total Firepower. Assault phase You must move the units in this detachment, and you may initiate an assault (see Assault moves and charges). These orders allow a detachment to move very quickly — but it can’t shoot, and it becomes an easy target for the enemy. Be careful! Detachments on March orders are especially vulnerable to enemy attacks. Movement phase You may make a triple move with units in this detachment. That is, make three normal moves in a single sequence. Shooting phase You may not shoot with units in this detachment. If your opponent shoots at this detachment then they will use the Marching column on the Firepower table. Assault phase You may not move units in this detachment. If the detachment becomes engaged in an assault then and you must halve the detachment’s Assault and Firepower totals. These orders cause a detachment to forgo most of its movement in favour of more accurate shooting. Movement phase You may move units in this detachment up to 5 cm only. Shooting phase You may shoot with units in this detachment — and you may re-roll misses that you roll with the attack dice. [TODO: Are there edge cases in which units in the detachment might be allowed to shoot outside of the Shooting phase (such as Flak attacks)? If yes then perhaps we need to make it clear that re-rolling of misses applies in those cases too?] Assault phase You may not move units in this detachment. We use this marker to indicate that special orders are in effect, such as Flak and Preparatory Bombardment. You cannot give a detachment orders while it is subject to a condition. When a detachment becomes subject to a condition then any orders that were in effect are no longer valid — remove the Order marker (if any) and place the appropriate Condition marker. A detachment becomes Broken when it loses a close combat or a firefight. This means that the detachment is in disarray — units are in a state of confusion or even panic, seeking cover and unable to accept and respond to orders. Be careful! A Broken detachment is especially easy for the enemy to destroy — especially if enemy units surround it. Movement phase You may make only a 20 cm Retreat move with units in this detachment (though you don’t have to move them at all if you don’t want to). Shooting phase You may not shoot with units in this detachment. Assault phase You may not move units in this detachment (aside from the initial Retreat move after losing an assault).

You must consider the risks and opportunities that the terrain presents to both your own forces and those of your opponent, at all times.

Impassable: The unit cannot move through the terrain at all, under any circumstances. Dangerous: The unit can attempt to enter the terrain but it might get stuck, or even suffer damage. When you wish to move a unit through dangerous terrain you must take a Dangerous terrain test for that unit. The effects often differ between unit types. Table 1.

Or, where the unit is already in dangerous terrain, you may not move it. Then roll a D6 again: If you roll another 1 then the unit takes a hit. On any other result: You may move the unit as normal. We explain the effect of hits at The Shooting phase. Hits from dangerous terrain do not cause critical damage on War Engine units. Where you will move a unit such that its entire move will take place on a road — in any phase — add 5 cm to its Speed value for that move. If the unit has a split Speed value, add 5 cm to its first Speed value and 10 cm to its second Speed value. Example 1. Movement on roads An Ork Boyz Infantry unit is on March orders. Ork Boyz have a Speed value of 10/20 cm. The player will make the first two moves entirely on roads, and the third move will include some open ground. So, the player could move the unit up to a maximum of 40 cm.

We represent this with a bonus that increases the Armour value of any infantry unit that is in such terrain. It is not possible to get an Armour value greater than 6+. Table 1.

[1] These abilities indicate units that can carry — transport — other units across the battlefield. These abilities have some features in common, but also differ in some important ways. To refer to the actions that we take with units that we transport, we use the terms embark and disembark. To refer to the units that we transport, we sometimes use the term cargo. To be clear, a transportation unit does not gain the abilities of any embarked units. To transport one or more valid cargo units: After you embark your cargo units, you can keep them embarked until you are ready to disembark them in some later phase. Or, you may embark and disembark units in the same phase or even in the same move — so long as all of the involved units have enough movement. While a cargo unit is embarked, you may perform no other actions with it — you cannot shoot with it, for example. You may only embark each cargo unit onto a Transport (X) unit once per phase. You may only disembark each cargo unit from a Transport (X) unit once per phase. To embark one or more valid cargo units: You may embark a cargo unit only when it is completely within 5 cm of the Transport (X) unit. You must pay 5 cm from the movement of the Transport (X) unit. You must pay 5 cm from the movement of each cargo unit. To disembark one or more cargo units: You must pay 5 cm from the movement of the Transport (X) unit. [2] You must pay 5 cm from the movement of each cargo unit that you wish to disembark. [2] Place each cargo unit that you disembark such that it is completely within 5 cm of the Transport (X) unit. Where a cargo unit or the Transport (X) unit has remaining movement, you may continue to move it. To transport one or more valid cargo units: You must embark and disembark each cargo unit in the same move — or in the same series of moves, if the Hitch (X) unit is on March orders. Embark each cargo unit at any point during your move of the Hitch (X) unit, and disembark at another point in same move, or series of moves. You may only embark each cargo unit onto a Hitch (X) unit once per phase — you may not hitch a lift multiple times with the same cargo unit in the same phase. To embark one or more valid cargo units: You may embark a cargo unit only when it is completely within 5 cm of the Hitch (X) unit. You do not need to pay any of the movement of the Hitch (X) unit. You must pay all of the movement of each cargo unit. To disembark one or more cargo units: You do not need to pay any of the movement of the Hitch (X) unit. Place each cargo unit that you disembark completely within 5 cm of the Hitch (X) unit. This ends the movement for the cargo unit. Where the Hitch (X) unit has remaining movement, you may continue to move it. If a transportation unit is destroyed then any cargo unit that is embarked at the time may also suffer a hit. Before you remove the destroyed transport unit, roll a D6 for each embarked unit: On a result of 1, 2 or 3, it suffers a hit. If the unit survives, place it completely within 5 cm of the destroyed transportation unit. [3] Then remove the transportation unit as normal. Where transportation units from one detachment carry units from another detachment, both detachments must be on the same orders. [4] Related information Transport (X) Hitch (X) 1. Difference from Epic 40,000: The Transport rules in Epic 40,000 leave a lot of room for interpretation, and they aren’t entirely clear on some of the commonalities and differences between Transport and Hitch. Nor do they account well for disparities that stem from the range of different base sizes that Epic enthusiasts use for their units these days. To minimise these problems, we’ve integrated the Transport (X) and Hitch (X) abilities with some new conditions. 2. In practice, these conditions mean that you can simply measure the movement of the cargo unit from the Transport (X) unit. But you must be able to pay the 5 cm costs first. 3. Difference from Epic 40,000: We make it clear that embarked units are subject to the same risk when their transportation unit is destroyed, regardless of which transportation ability is in effect. 4.

Vehicles probe and break through enemy lines, or prevent enemy attempts to do the same. Aircraft fight for dominance of the sky and bomb enemy positions. Infantry rush from cover to cover and fight desperate hand-to-hand combats to secure positions that other forces can’t reach or can’t hold. All these forces must work together to secure victory for their side. The playing pieces that we use to play Epic Remastered represent the many and varied forces that are at war on battlefields of the 41st millennium. In game terms, each individual playing piece represents a single independent element of these forces, known as a unit. Each unit is also of a particular named kind, such as Ork Boyz or Land Raider. Each kind has a unique set of characteristics that define its capabilities on the battlefield, which we explain at Data sheets and characteristics. Units vary widely in their specific characteristics and capabilities, but for rules purposes we classify each unit by unit type: Infantry (INF) Vehicle (VEH) War Engine (WE) Flyer (FLY) See below for more detail about each of these unit types. [1] This unit type includes the most obvious infantry, plus the likes of crew-served field artillery and some heroic characters. It also includes some creatures and small machines that operate in a similar way as far as we’re concerned with the rules. Examples include the Space Marines unit, Ork Boyz, Eldar Support Weapon Platform, Tyranid Hormagaunts, and many more. Physical representation of Infantry units We typically represent Infantry units as follows: 'Normal' infantry: Commonly five infantry models affixed to a single base. That said, some enthusiasts vary this with a greater or lesser number, where the models represent particularly weak or powerful individuals. Field artillery: One or two artillery piece models affixed to a single base — usually along with some infantry models to represent the crew. Wargamers often refer to such a playing piece as a 'base' or 'stand' of infantry. The most common formats of the actual bases are: 20 mm square 40 mm by 12 mm oblong strip 25 mm diameter circle But, just about any shape and size is acceptable, as long as they are: no smaller than 20 mm wide by 10 mm deep no larger than 40 mm wide by 40 mm deep This unit type includes the most obvious vehicles, plus some large beasts and mounted infantry (which can’t take advantage of terrain in quite the same way as smaller beasts and normal infantry). Examples include: Tanks, such as the Imperial Guard Leman Russ. Armoured personnel carriers, such as the Space Marine Rhino. Walking machines, such as the Eldar War Walker and various Dreadnought units. Some large, powerful beasts, such as the Ork Squiggoth and the Tyranid Carnifex. Mounted infantry, such as the Ork Boarboyz and the Eldar Jetbikes. Physical representation of Vehicle units We typically represent Vehicle units as follows: Tank or armoured personnel carrier: A single vehicle model. Some players like to affix their vehicle models to bases, but this is not necessary and makes little difference in game terms. Do as you prefer. Walking machine or large, powerful beast: A single walker or beast model, usually affixed to a base for stability. Mounted infantry: Two or three mounted infantry models affixed to a single base. This unit type includes very large and tough machines of war, plus some exceptionally powerful and resilient creatures. Examples include the super-heavy tanks and Titans of various factions, Gargants (which are the Ork equivalent of Titans) and some giant bio-constructs such as the Tyranid Dominatrix. These units dwarf the units of other unit types and can absorb a lot more damage before they are destroyed. Best of all, many of these behemoths have multiple huge weapon systems that can rain destruction upon your enemies! Physical representation of War Engine units We represent each War Engine unit with a single model. Some players like to affix their war engine models to bases, but this is not necessary and makes little difference in game terms. That said, where a war engine model has legs, it is usual to affix it to a base — both for stability and for clarity of measurements and other interactions during the game. Aircraft, and even some creatures that can fly within a planet’s atmosphere. These are very fast in comparison to ground-based units, and their presence over the field of battle is fleeting. Examples include the Ork Fighta-Bommer, Space Marine Thunderhawk Gunship and Tyranid Harridan. Note that 'skimmer' units such as the Space Marine Land Speeder and Eldar Falcon grav-tank are not aircraft, and do not count as Flyer units. Rather, these units have some unique capabilities that we represent with the Skimmer special ability. Otherwise, they behave just like other 'ground units' of the same unit type. Physical representation of Flyer units We usually represent each Flyer unit with a single model on a 'flying stand' — that is, the model sits on top of a vertical rod that is affixed to a base, to raise the model above the height of other units on the tabletop. 1. Our notes on physical representation are guidance, not a set of absolute rules requirements. As long as your miniatures look the part so that it is clear what they represent, and as long as you don’t abuse the flexibility for competitive advantage, then you won’t go far wrong.","title":"Units and unit types","component":"core","version":"","name":"units-and-unit-types","url":"/core/main-rules/units-and-unit-types.html","titles":[{"text":"Units","hash":"_units","id":1},{"text":"Unit types","hash":"unit-types","id":2},{"text":"Infantry (INF)","hash":"_infantry_inf","id":3},{"text":"Vehicle (VEH)","hash":"_vehicle_veh","id":4},{"text":"War Engine (WE)","hash":"_war_engine_we","id":5},{"text":"Flyer (FLY)","hash":"_flyer_fly","id":6}]},"101":{"id":101,"text":"Epic Remastered uses ordinary six-sided dice. When you roll a die, the value it gives you is the result. This is a 'natural' or 'unmodified' value. It is also your initial score — but the score may be subject to further adjustment before it is final (see Modifiers). Roll a D6 or 1D6 means roll a single six-sided die and use the result as the score. Roll 2D6 means roll two six-sided dice and add the results together to get the score. Roll 3D6 means roll three six-sided dice and add the results together to get the score. [and so on] Roll a D3 simply means roll a single six-sided die and then halve the D6 result (rounding up) to get the D3 result for your score. In other words, count a D6 result of 1–2 as a score of 1, a result of 3–4 as a score of 2, and a result of 5–6 as a score of 3. Rounding of fractions Unless the rules say otherwise, round fractions up. Roll three D6s means roll three six-sided dice all at the same time, and then check each of their results to get three separate scores. Each individual die is a single D6 roll. Re-rolls Sometimes the rules allow you to re-roll dice when you fail a test or you don’t like the result of your first roll. Unless the rules specifically say otherwise, re-rolls only apply to single rolls, and you must re-roll all of the dice in that single roll, or none of them. You may not re-roll more than once (you can’t re-roll a re-roll) and you must accept the result of the second roll. Sometimes the rules specify that you must add or subtract values from the result that you roll on the dice, to get the final score. For example, D6+6 means roll one six-sided die and add 6 to the result. Thus your final score will be in the range of 7 to 12. 1+ means you need a score of 1 or more, after modifiers. If there are no negative modifiers then you will automatically succeed without having to roll a die, unless the rules say otherwise (for example, shooting always misses on a D6 result of 1 (sometimes called a 'natural roll' or 'unmodified roll' of 1). 2+ means you need a score of 2 or more, after modifiers. [and so on] Ties and tie-breaking 'roll offs' In the case of a tie or any situation where the rules allow you and your opponent to do something at the same time, just 'roll off' against each other.

You can use Flyer units that have the Transport (X) ability to carry valid cargo units from other detachments in your army. Keep the cargo units outside the play area along with the transport Flyer units until you are ready to deploy them. If your available Transport (X) flyer units don’t have enough transport capacity to carry all of the units in your ground detachment in one trip, then choose which units to leave behind for the current mission. You can bring them into play on a future turn. Be sure to include the detachment HQ in the first wave unless you want all of your units to be out of command! Similarly, disembark later arrivals within 30 cm of whichever unit is currently the HQ unit, unless you want them to be out of command. You must declare each Flyer detachment that you wish to perform this mission at the appropriate step in the Start phase. When play passes to you in the Movement phase, place all of the Ready units in the detachment at any point along any edge of the playing area. You must place them so that they all face in the same direction. This is where they will start their attack run. Flyers have an unlimited move, but you can only move them in the direction that they face when you place them. So, you must move all Flyer units that are in the same detachment in parallel courses, in formation. Enemy units can Snap Fire at them as they move — but in contrast to ground units, Snap Fire does not halt the movement of Flyer units. You may halt movement of Flyer units at any point — halt them all at the same time. If a Transport (X) Flyer unit is destroyed while airborne then any embarked cargo units are destroyed along with it — there is no possibility that they can escape destruction in this case! Make ranged attacks with the Flyer units, just like you would with ground units in the Shooting phase — use the Firepower values of the Flyer units and any super-heavy weapons that they have. But note: You can draw a line of fire only where an enemy unit lies within range and inside the forward 90° arc of your Flyer unit. Ignore any intervening terrain though, as it is far below the altitude of the flyers. Otherwise, the attack works just like a normal shooting attack — so for example,as long as you meet the other requirements then you may split fire between multiple target detachments. Halve the Firepower of each Transport (X) Flyer unit that will disembark cargo units (and roll to lock on with any super-heavy weapons). After you resolve the shooting effects, disembark the cargo units just like you would with a ground transportation unit. But note: In each case, measure from the centre of the transport flyer’s flight stand. [TODO: Are there any awkward edge cases where this 'measure from the centre' restriction poses a problem? If yes, what is the best alternative given the variety of base and model sizes that is even more variable than with ground units?] Give the disembarked detachment whatever orders you prefer, except that you may not choose Overwatch or March orders. To be clear, you may put the detachment on Assault orders and make assault moves in the usual way this turn. [TODO: When exactly should we complete the move with the disembarked detachment? Presumably we should complete the move as part of the mission, either now or immediately after we remove the flyers in the next step?] After you complete the disembarkation, the transport flyers take off and disengage. They go to full power and rapidly climb out of reach of ground-based weapons. Remove the flyers from the play area and place them in the Rearm state.

So, you only need your Artillery unit to be within range when you choose your target — they do not need a line of fire. Artillery units can bombard enemy forces to forestall an attack or to 'soften up' an enemy position. We represent such attacks with special orders called Preparatory Bombardment.

The more closely packed the units of the target detachment, the more effective Barrage weapons are likely to be against it. This is simply because the barrage will have more target units within its area of effect. When you make a Barrage shot: Place a Barrage template in the standard way, but with these additional considerations: Place only a single template, no matter how many Barrage units in your detachment contribute to the attack. Place the template so that it is completely within range and line of fire of all of the Barrage units that contribute to the attack. You may opt to exclude some Barrage units from the attack, but you may not make any separate attack with them against the same target detachment. Cover as many units in the target detachment as possible. Count the number of units of the target detachment that are under the template. This number is the Firepower value that each Barrage unit contributes to the total Firepower that your detachment directs at the target detachment. When you place Blast markers, Barrage weapons contribute to your detachment’s total Firepower, but not to the number of super-heavy weapons. It still takes only a single Blast marker to suppress a Barrage weapon though, just like any other super-heavy weapon. Barrage and intermingled detachments under the template After you place the template to cover as many units in the target detachment as possible, it may be that the template also covers some units from another detachment. Make a separate count of the number of units of the other detachment that are under the template. After you have resolved the attack against the target detachment, use the separate count to resolve the attack against the other detachment, as if it were a separate attack. Example 1. A classic Barrage unit The Space Marine Whirlwind armoured vehicle is armed with a Whirlwind missile launcher. What this vehicle lacks in range it can make up for in speed and the ability to rain a destructive barrage of missiles down onto an area of the battlefield. Example 2. Adding up Barrage Firepower You shoot with three Space Marine Whirlwind units at an Ork Warband detachment. This target detachment is partially intermingled with a Kult of Speed detachment. Figure 1. Adding up Barrage Firepower. Numbered rectangles are Ork Boyz units; solid circles are Gunwagon units; semi-opaque circles are Barrage templates. Green units are in the Ork Warband detachment; red units are in the Kult of Speed detachment. You place one Barrage template for all three Whirlwinds. In total, the template covers three units from the target detachment: The template covers Ork Boyz (1) and (2), and the Gunwagon. Ork Boyz (3) is not covered by the template because their centre is not under the template. Ork Boyz (4) is in a different detachment, the Kult of Speed — so we make a separate count to resolve the attack against that detachment. So, against the target detachment, each Whirlwind adds 3 Firepower to the total for your detachment’s attack. As the Whirlwinds have no other help, the total is 9 Firepower against the Ork Warband detachment. After you resolve that, you also resolve the attack against the Kult of Speed detachment. Each Whirlwind contributes 1 Firepower in this case, for a total of 3 Firepower.

Flyers have data sheets just like regular units — but with these differences: The Speed value is always Flyer. Flyer units are so fast that we treat them as though their Speed value is unlimited — you can move them as far as you wish across the play area. The Assault value is a split value, such as 2/2. We call this the 'Dogfight value' — although most of the time we refer specifically to only one of its two parts: The first number is the Intercept value of the flyer, which represents its overall manoeuvrability. The second number is its Gunnery value, which represents the overall deadliness of the flyer’s air-to-air weaponry, when it can get an enemy flyer in its sights. You don’t deploy flyers along with other units at the start of the battle — place them somewhere outside of the playing area, in the Ready state (see Flyer readiness states). You can imagine that they are in orbit, or stationed at a nearby airbase. Do not place Blast markers on Flyer detachments, at all.

The Firepower table includes target categories especially for War Engines and for Immobilised War Engines. These categories reflect the fact that these units are so large and easy to hit. A War Engine unit can become Immobilised — and so even easier to hit — as a result of critical damage. There is no target category for 'Immobilised War Engine in the open' — instead, you simply roll as many attack dice as the resultant Firepower that you direct at the unit. If a target detachment contains both mobile and Immobilised War Engine units, then you may choose to shoot at only those that are Immobilised, if you wish. If you do this then you may allocate hits to the Immobilised units only. Unlike other units, War Engine units can absorb more than one hit before they are destroyed. Each War Engine unit has an initial Damage Capacity value on its data sheet, which shows how many hits it can take before it is destroyed. Each unsaved hit reduces the current Damage Capacity of the War Engine unit by one point. The unit is destroyed only when its current Damage Capacity value reaches zero. How to keep track of damage To keep track of remaining Damage Capacity on each damaged War Engine unit you might simply keep notes on a piece of paper. Or, you may like to use coloured dice or 'damage tracker' dials — when a War Engine takes damage, place a die or dial near it at the correct value to show the remaining Damage Capacity for that unit. Where the target detachment consists of more than one War Engine unit, allocate hits in the usual way. So, allocate one hit to the nearest available target unit, then the next nearest, and so on.

This is usually a moment of high drama and excitement — will your carefully positioned behemoths live up to their fearsome reputations and lay waste to the enemy? War engines make excellent mobile weapons platforms — but their sheer mass means that they can’t point their weapons in any direction at a moment’s notice. The rules here add some extra detail to reflect these features. Each War Engine unit has one or more weapon mounts. [1] These are simply the weapon-carrying locations on the war engine, and have names like Left Carapace or Right Arm. Each weapon mount also has: A weapon system that defines the weapon effects that exist in this mount (Weapon systems). A weapon arc that restricts the line of fire of the weapon system (Weapon arcs). We list each weapon mount that a War Engine has in a separate line on the unit’s data sheet, along with the corresponding weapon system details and weapon arc. Each weapon system provides one of these weapon combinations: [1] One or more shots from a ranged super-heavy weapon. Multiple shots from such a weapon system are just like multiples of that super-heavy weapon, except that we treat the weapon system like a single super-heavy weapon for various game effects. A close combat super-heavy weapon, such as Close Combat Weapons or Ripper Tentacles. In some cases the weapon system may combine this with a basic Firepower value. A basic Firepower value. This represents some kind of battery of heavy weapons. Where you can choose from a wide range of weapon systems, we leave empty boxes on the data sheet for you to fill with the information to match your particular choices. While you may split fire to target different detachments with different weapon systems, you may not split fire with the effects of a single weapon system. For critical damage results, apply effects that destroy or restrict a weapon to the whole weapon system. [TODO: If we reference 'weapon system' rather than 'weapon' on every data sheet in future, perhaps we can do away with this bullet point?] Where a weapon system does not have a basic Firepower value, treat it like a single super-heavy weapon: When your detachment’s Firepower is halved for any reason, roll to lock on with each of its super-heavy weapon systems — not with each individual shot. Super-heavy weapon systems may contribute to the placement of Blast markers in one of two main ways, depending on whether or not they contribute Firepower in the attack. After Firepower, each remaining Blast marker suppresses one entire super-heavy weapon system. In a firefight, a super-heavy weapon system contributes 1 Firepower — regardless of the number of shots. Each weapon mount on a War Engine unit has a weapon arc. [2] The arc constrains the line of fire for the weapon system in that mount. You may only use weapons in that weapon system to target detachments that are inside within that arc, and you may only allocate hits to units that are inside of that arc. We use icons on the War Engine data sheets to show what arc applies to each weapon mount. Figure 1. Anatomy of a weapon arc icon The arrow in the centre of each icon represents the facing of the war engine. The black segment indicates the weapon arc, relative to the facing. Figure 2. Weapon arc icons From top-left to bottom-right, these icons represent: Front-left 180°; Front 90°; Front 180°; Front-right 180° Left 180°; All Around (360°); Rear 180°; Right 180° Related information The Shooting phase Super-heavy weapons 1.

Half Firepower and 'lock on' Where a game effect forces you to halve the Firepower of a detachment or unit, you also suffer a reduction in the effectiveness of its super-heavy weapons. [1] In these situations, you must test to lock on with each super-heavy weapon before you can shoot with it. Lock on For each super-heavy weapon that you wish to shoot, roll a D6. On a roll of 4+ the weapon locks on successfully, so you may shoot with it. Otherwise, you may not shoot with it this time. Overwatch Where a unit that is equipped with super-heavy weapons is on Overwatch orders you may re-roll misses when you shoot with these weapons, just as you do with dice that you get from Firepower. When you shoot with a detachment that includes super-heavy weapons, you may get to place two lots of Blast markers: For any regular Firepower that your detachment brings to bear on the target detachment, place Blast markers as normal.

Do not modify this number because of Assault orders, Blast markers on the shooting detachment, or anything similar. Do not count super-heavy weapons that add to the detachment’s Firepower total, such as Barrage — the Firepower component already accounts for any Blast markers that they may add. Normally, suppression means that for each Blast marker on a detachment you must reduce its Firepower total by 1. However, if the detachment has more Blast markers than Firepower, or has no Firepower, then for each remaining Blast marker you lose the ability to shoot with one super-heavy weapon. You may choose which super-heavy weapons are suppressed. The entire super-heavy weapon is suppressed, even if it has multiple shots like Pulsar (X), or adds to a detachment’s Firepower like Barrage. Where a super-heavy weapon is in a position to contribute to a firefight, it contributes 1 Firepower. Example 1.

You may make more turns, at a cost of 5 cm of the unit’s move per extra turn of up to 45°. Example 1. Forward movement of War Engine units [TODO: Diagram needed.] You wish to engage some Space Marine units before they can reach the cover of woods and flank your Ork Great Gargant. You want to manoeuvre your Gargant towards the Space Marines, around the woods. It has a Speed value of 15 cm. You move it as follows: Forward 5 cm, then a free 45° turn. Forward 5 cm, and then another 45° turn which costs the last 5 cm of the Gargant’s movement. Now the Gargant is in the perfect position to blast the Space Marines with its ranged weapons! [TODO: Should we mention Snap Fire here, to be absolutely clear? Or make the graphic such that the Gargant clearly isn’t within 10 cm, so this doesn’t come up?] Another option would be to make the free 45° turn at the start, and move up to 15 cm straight towards the Space Marines, through the woods. But then you would have to take your chances with a dangerous terrain test. You may move a War Engine unit backwards, though not as fast. Make the move in the same way as for forward movement, except that you may not move the unit more than 5 cm. In the Assault phase, you may choose not to move units in a War Engine detachment — but then you may not initiate close combats or firefights with them either. Otherwise, War Engine units are subject to the same movement restrictions in the Assault phase as other units, but their own movement restrictions take priority. Where appropriate, you must make a dangerous terrain test with a War Engine unit, just like any other unit. The effects of a failed test are the same, but note that if the War Engine suffers a hit there is no chance that it will inflict critical damage. [TODO: At the moment, the dangerous terrain test topic includes a note about the 'no chance of critical damage' point. Should we remove it from there, or leave it as a reminder?

The technologies reflect different approaches but achieve a similar defensive effect. Power fields are many but irreplaceable during a battle, while void shields are fewer but repairable. Where a War Engine is equipped with power field or void shield technology, its data sheet will tell you this — along with how many fields or shields it has at the start of the battle.

How to keep track of fields/shields You can track remaining fields/shields in a similar way to Damage Capacity — just be sure to differentiate so that you are clear about which tracker relates to which feature on which War Engine.

To be clear, when we refer to the end of the Rally phase in this topic, we mean specifically during step R4. Check the game end conditions. In scenarios that use Army Morale: The opposing armies each have an Army Morale value. At the start of the game, your Army Morale value is simply the total of all Detachment Morale values in your army. Each player’s Army Morale value will change throughout the course of the game as your armies clash, and as you vie for control of objectives. The goal is to reduce your opponent’s Army Morale value to zero or less before they do the same to you. At the end of the Rally phase, after you’ve applied all modifiers that have triggered: If a player has an Army Morale value of zero or less then the game ends and the other player is the winner. (We assume that the player’s army is no longer effective and disengages from the enemy.) If both players' Army Morale values are zero or less then the game ends and the player whose value is highest is the winner. (A Pyrrhic victory, perhaps!) When you build your army in the standard way, you calculate the Morale value of each detachment and record this alongside other features of the detachment. The formula for the Morale value of a detachment is as follows: Detachment Morale value = points value total of the detachment, divided by 50 (round up) [1] Example 1. Detachment Morale values A detachment that has a points value total anywhere in the range of 201 to 250 points has a Morale value of 5. There are lots of effects that can modify your Army Morale value. We list the main ones here. Morale effects can be either ongoing or one-time: Ongoing morale effects These effects can repeat in a given context, such that we apply their modifiers multiple times throughout the course of a game. We check for ongoing morale effects every turn, at the end of the Rally phase. We apply the appropriate modifiers for any ongoing morale effects that are applicable at that time. One-time morale effects These effects do not repeat — we apply their modifiers only once for a given context. In general, one-time morale effects can become applicable at almost any time — although there are some that we check at the end of the Rally phase. (This is also a good time to double-check for any that we might’ve forgotten to apply during the heat of battle!) We apply the appropriate modifier immediately whenever a one-time effect becomes applicable. Ongoing morale effect: Check at the end of each Rally phase. For each Blast marker that remains on any of your detachments, deduct 1 point from your current Army Morale value. One-time morale effect: This applies no more than once per detachment. When a detachment in your army is reduced to half of its initial strength, subtract its Morale value from your current Army Morale value. [TODO: It’d probably be best to define a term such as 'Detachment Strength' — perhaps in the 'Common rules' section — and then use this term throughout the project wherever it is relevant for Leadership tests, assaults, Army Morale, and so on.] Example 2. Infantry/Vehicle detachment at half strength Before the start of the game, your Imperial Guard Infantry detachment had 20 units. It suffers losses to the extent that only 10 or fewer units remain. When this happens, you deduct the Morale value of this detachment from your Army Morale value. Example 3. War Engine detachment at half strength Before the start of the game, your Imperial Guard Super-heavy Tanks detachment had three Baneblades, each with a Damage Capacity value of 4 — a total Damage Capacity of 12. It suffers damage to the extent that the remaining Baneblades have only 6 or fewer points of current Damage Capacity left between them. When this happens, you deduct the Morale value of this detachment from your Army Morale value. One-time morale effect: This applies no more than once per War Engine unit. Where an enemy War Engine unit suffers a Catastrophic Damage result of Destroyed — not merely Wrecked — add half of that unit’s Morale value to your own Army Morale value. [2] Note that this applies even in detachments that include two or more War Engine units — add half the value of the individual War Engine unit, not half the value of the detachment as a whole. One-time morale effect: This applies no more than once per detachment. When one of your detachments is completely destroyed, immediately deduct 1 point from your Army Morale value for each Blast marker that was on the detachment at the time!

For each of your units that has a Rescue objective (that is, for each of your units that currently count as an escort unit), apply both of these modifiers: Add 1 point to your Army Morale value. Your opponent must deduct 1 point from their Army Morale value. Cleanse Ongoing morale effect: Check at the end of each Rally phase. For each of your Cleanse objectives that you control, add 1 point to your Army Morale value. Bunker One-time morale effect: Each time you destroy one of your bunker objectives. Roll a D6 — your opponent must subtract the score from their Army Morale value. Capture One-time morale effect: Check at the end of each Rally phase. For each of your Capture objectives that you control, choose and apply one of these effects: Capture: Roll a D6 — add the score to your Army Morale value. Destroy: Roll a D6 — your opponent must subtract the score from their Army Morale value. 1. As we round up to get each Detachment Morale value, two armies of the same points value may nevertheless have slightly different initial Army Morale values. This does not imply any advantage or disadvantage to either player. 2. This represents the boost to morale that troops get when they see an imposing enemy war engine destroyed in spectacular fashion!","title":"Army Morale","component":"battles","version":"","name":"army-morale","url":"/battles/scenario-special-rules/army-morale.html","titles":[{"text":"The Army Morale value","hash":"_the_army_morale_value","id":1},{"text":"Detachment Morale values","hash":"_detachment_morale_values","id":2},{"text":"Army Morale effects and modifiers","hash":"_army_morale_effects_and_modifiers","id":3},{"text":"Morale: Blast markers on your detachments","hash":"_morale_blast_markers_on_your_detachments","id":4},{"text":"Morale: Detachment reduced to half-strength","hash":"_morale_detachment_reduced_to_half_strength","id":5},{"text":"Morale: Enemy War Engine unit destroyed","hash":"_morale_enemy_war_engine_unit_destroyed","id":6},{"text":"Morale: Blast markers on a destroyed detachment","hash":"_morale_blast_markers_on_a_destroyed_detachment","id":7},{"text":"Morale: Objectives","hash":"_morale_objectives","id":8}]},"221":{"id":221,"text":"Drop pods are single-use planetary landing craft which afford commanders the means to send units from ships in orbit and straight into battle — without the need for transport aircraft. We also use the Drop Pods rules to represent some other technologies that perform a similar function. Drop pods miniatures You do not need to have any miniatures to represent drop pods. But, if you have some and you enjoy the spectacle, it can be fun to use them — and if your opponent agrees, you could allow infantry to use them as cover. There are two main ways that we determine when you may use the Drop Pods rules — either by the scenario that you intend to play, or by the composition of detachments in your army. Some scenarios state conditions under which you may use the Drop Pods rules for some detachments. Example 1. Scenarios that let you use the Drop Pods rules The Battle 6: Planetary Assault scenario lets the attacker use Drop Pods to bring some of their first wave of troops into play. Some army lists let you build specific detachments that can use the Drop Pods rules in any scenario that does not explicitly forbid them. You can do this where: The notes for the detachment state that you may use the Drop Pods rules — so long as you also meet any extra restrictions that these notes specify. You build a detachment that contains only units that have the Deep Strike ability, or that are embarked in units that have both the Transport (X) and Deep Strike abilities. You build a detachment that contains only units that have the Tunneller ability, or that are embarked in units that have both the Transport (X) and Tunneller abilities. Unless a scenario says otherwise, you don’t have to use the Drop Pods rules with such detachments — you can still deploy them in the usual way, if you prefer. Example 2. Detachments that let you use the Drop Pods rules In the Imperial army list: The Space Marine detachment specifies criteria that allow you to build detachments with which you can use the Drop Pods rules. The Imperial Tunneller Company detachment offers units that have both the Transport (X) and Tunneller abilities. This means that you may use the Drop Pods rules with this detachment — and, if you have another detachment that is comprised solely of suitable 'cargo' units, you may have the tunnellers carry that detachment into battle too. In the Craftworld Eldar army list: The Eldar Warhost detachment includes Swooping Hawk Aspect Warriors, among the choices you can make. For any Eldar Warhost detachment you build that includes only Swooping Hawk Aspect Warriors units, their Deep Strike ability lets you use the Drop Pods rules with that detachment. When you intend to use the Drop Pods rules in a game, act as follows. For convenience, we refer to any valid detachment that you intend to use with the Drop Pods rules as a 'Drop Pods detachment'. Place all Drop Pods detachments in Reserves. Drop Pods detachments must always start the game in Reserves. No matter what units they contain, all Drop Pods detachments have a Reserve Speed of 30 cm. When a Drop Pods detachment arrives from Reserves during a Start phase, choose any point in the play area and place a suitable marker there to act as a reminder; this is the landing zone target point for the incoming drop pods of that detachment. After a given Drop Pods detachment arrives, you must put it into play in the following Movement Phase. When you are ready to put it into play, proceed as follows: Decide what orders to give to the detachment: You may choose only Assault orders or Advance orders. Gather your Drop Pods tokens — you need one token for each unit in the detachment. Use pen and paper to record which individual unit corresponds to each specific numbered token. Place all of the tokens on a Barrage template. Hold the template 30 cm (12 inches) directly above the target point marker that you placed earlier. Invert the template sharply, so that the tokens fall and distribute themselves across the surface of the play area below. Hopefully they’ll all land in a random spread that is fairly close to the target point marker. Remove the target point marker — you no longer need it. Identify all units that correspond to tokens that landed outside of the play area or in terrain that is Impassable to Vehicle units. These units are destroyed. Your opponent may resolve Snap Fire against all tokens that are within 10 cm of any of their units. If your opponent has Flak units that are on Flak orders then they may resolve shots as if the tokens are Flyer units (use the Armour value of the unit that corresponds to the token). Remove tokens that suffer a hit and identify the corresponding units — these units are destroyed. For each token that remains in the play area, replace it with its corresponding unit. You may now move the units of this detachment in the usual way, as appropriate to the orders you chose for them. Place the appropriate Order marker, if you haven’t already.

Razorwire is a simple but effective menace to infantry, and even to vehicles. Well-placed razorwire can slow down enemy forces at a critical point, or funnel them into a crossfire. Forces in fortified positions are harder to destroy with shooting, and more difficult to reach with assaults too. Where a scenario tells you that you may use fortifications, use them as follows. Place these fortifications before the start of the game, in your deployment zone, at the same time as you deploy your detachments. Note that you may deploy only Infantry units within these fortifications, as fortifications are Impassable to Vehicle and War Engine units. To the extent that you have suitable scenic items, you may set up any amount of these fortifications. Keep in mind that the more of these fortifications you put into play, the greater the risk that your opponent will use them against when they overrun part of your position! [TODO: Shouldn’t War Engine units be able to cross trenches…​? Perhaps it’d be good to expand these rules a bit to differentiate between hasty entrenchments and the likes of hardened bunkers and redoubts…​? And perhaps to allow Vehicle units to use emplacements?

You may place each section of razorwire anywhere that is within 15 cm of either: The units you deployed. Hidden Setup markers that you placed instead of units. No player may move Vehicle or Infantry units over razorwire while those units are subject to March or Assault orders — unless those units have either the Skimmer or Jump Packs ability.

Where a scenario tells you that you that the Defender uses the Hidden Setup rules, act as follows. Gather your Hidden Setup markers. You need one for each detachment of Infantry and/or Vehicle units in your army — regardless of whether or not any of these detachments will be in Reserves or otherwise not deployed at the start of the game. You do not need markers for War Engine units — they’re simply too big to hide! Use pen and paper to record which numbered Hidden Setup marker corresponds to each specific Infantry and/or Vehicle detachment. During deployment for the scenario, place your Hidden Setup markers instead of the detachments they represent. You may place a given marker within terrain, as long the corresponding detachment includes at least one unit that can move into that terrain. (See Terrain effects on movement.) You can shoot your detachments at the Defender’s Hidden Setup markers. Although your forces can’t see where the enemy units are, they can shoot at likely locations in the hope that they achieve a useful amount of suppression. Each time you shoot with one of your detachments at a Hidden Setup marker, resolve the shooting much as if the Hidden Setup marker were a detachment, but with these differences: [TODO: How, exactly do we resolve shooting at these markers? For example, if the marker is in cover, do we use the 'Vehicle or Infantry in cover' column on the Firepower table, and apply the Infantry Armour bonus for cover?] The target detachment that corresponds to the marker does not suffer any casualties from hits. Calculate Blast markers as normal, but place these next to the Hidden Setup marker — they might affect the Defender later. For the purposes of Army Morale values, ignore Blast markers that are on Hidden Setup markers. You cannot move or shoot with a hidden detachment until you reveal it. You may reveal any hidden detachment at any time during the game turn — even if this interrupts your opponent’s movement actions. When you reveal a detachment, proceed to deploy it as at Deploy a revealed detachment (Defender). As soon as an enemy ground unit moves within 15 cm of a Hidden Setup marker, you must reveal the nature of that marker and act as follows: [1] If the marker corresponds to a detachment that is in Reserves, or that you may not deploy yet for any other reason, then this marker is a 'dummy' — it represents an area that might contain mere decoys, or that may also contain booby-traps or a minefield! Do not place any units, and instead go to Dummy markers, booby-traps and minefields. Otherwise, proceed to Deploy a revealed detachment (Defender). Choose one of your units from the corresponding detachment and put it in the place of the Hidden Setup marker. Then place all the rest of the units from that detachment within 15 cm of this unit — but not within 15 cm of any enemy unit. Transfer any Blast markers that the Hidden Setup marker has to the detachment, and then remove the Hidden Setup marker. Decide what orders you want for the detachment, and place an Order marker as appropriate. Apply the effects of Blast markers as normal; for example, if you want to place Overwatch orders then you must first pass a Leadership test. [TODO: Resolve inconsistency: The original text here is inconsistent with the usual rules, because it implies that all 'special' orders require a Leadership test just to set them, like Overwatch does: \"When a hidden detachment is revealed the owning player may place it on special orders if he wants to (eg, Overwatch or Assault), but if there are any Blast markers on the detachment it must pass a Leadership test first.\"] When the approach of an enemy unit forces you to reveal a dummy Hidden Setup marker, roll a D6: [2] 1 to 3: The marker represents decoys only — discard it with no further effect (along with any Blast markers it has). 4 to 6: The marker represents not only decoys but also an area of either booby-traps or a minefield; as the controlling player, you may choose which it is. Roll a D6: On a result of 2+, the enemy unit that forced the reveal of the dummy marker takes a hit. Then discard the marker (along with any Blast markers it has). If you have a suitable scenic item then you may replace the dummy marker with a minefield in the same position. Minefield items can be up to 15 cm long by 5 cm wide. Any time an enemy unit enters a minefield, make an attack with a Firepower value of 1 — that is, always roll one attack die. This minefield attack affects the target unit directly — it bypasses any void shields and power fields that might otherwise protect the target unit. A given minefield can attack any number of different units in a turn, but can only attack the same unit once in a turn. Units that start a turn within a given minefield suffer an attack from that minefield only if they move. Skimmer and Jump Packs units do suffer the effects of minefields, but Flyer units do not. [3] Related information Hidden Setup markers 1. Flyer units cannot reveal hidden detachments. 2. Only dummy markers that are revealed by enemy movement can be booby-traps or a minefield. If for any reason you voluntarily reveal a marker that does not correlate to a detachment that you will deploy immediately, then that dummy marker automatically has no further effect. 3. Difference from Epic 40,000: The original rules are ambiguous on this point, but we think it makes sense that a unit that crosses multiple different minefields in a single phase will be subject to multiple attacks.

Such scenarios explain what objective markers to place. They may also include special instructions that add to or over-ride the default rules that we explain here. There are various types of objective, and each type has specific restrictions on where you can place corresponding markers. However, you must also observe these general restrictions by default: You may not place any objective marker within 15 cm of any of your other objective markers. You may not place any objective marker within 15 cm of the edge of the playing area — unless the scenario specifies that your forces enter from that edge. (In effect, that table edge is the leading edge of your deployment zone.) We recommend that you base all objective-related measurements on the centres of the markers rather than on their edges. This gives you a bit more room to place them and means that it doesn’t really matter exactly how big or small each marker is. For the most part, you can only benefit from your own objectives. Except where the rules say otherwise, you gain nothing from control of your opponent’s objectives. Of course, it is in your interests to prevent your opponent from getting the benefits of their objectives. The standard objective types and their default rules are as follows. [TODO: We should tweak the 'R4. Check the game end conditions' topic and the 'End of turn' part of the turn sequence, and rationalise how we refer to objectives and Morale effects that we check or apply 'in the Rally phase' or 'at the end of the turn'. At present, the arrangement incorrectly implies that some Morale effects happen after we check for the game end conditions in the turn sequence.] This objective represents a location on the battlefield that is vital or highly advantageous to hold for as long as possible in the face of the enemy. Placement: You must place the objective marker either in your opponent’s deployment zone or more than 90 cm away from your deployment zone. Game effects and control: At the end of the Rally phase: If you have a unit that is within 15 cm of your Take & Hold objective marker and closer to it than any enemy units, then you are in control of this objective this turn. Morale effect: At the end of each Rally phase: For each Take & Hold objective that you control, add D3 points to your Army Morale value. This objective represents something that is significant to both sides in the conflict — something that both sides wish to control, to the exclusion of the other. Vital plans perhaps, or an important hostage. Placement: You must place the objective marker more than 90 cm away from your deployment zone and within a terrain feature that offers an Infantry Armour bonus for cover. Game effects and control: When a player moves a ground unit that they control onto the objective marker, they may use that unit to 'pick up' the objective. We call this the 'escort unit'. The player can then continue to use the escort unit entirely as normal for its type — it’s just that the objective travels with it. If the escort unit is destroyed, leave the objective marker at that point on the playing surface — leave the marker there until either player moves a unit they control over it, picks it up, and becomes the current escort unit. If the escort unit is destroyed in close combat then, if there is a surviving enemy unit that was in base contact with the escort unit, the opposing player may declare this unit as the new escort unit and pick up the objective immediately. To be clear, only you can make the initial pick up of your Rescue objective. However, once you have done this, it is possible for your opponent to destroy your escort unit and then have one of their units pick up your unescorted Rescue objective and become the current escort unit, as we explain above. Morale effect: At the end of each Rally phase: For each of your units that has a Rescue objective (that is, for each of your units that currently count as an escort unit), apply both of these effects: Add 1 point to your Army Morale value. Your opponent must deduct 1 point from their Army Morale value. This objective represents an area that you want to keep out of the enemy’s hands. Placement: You must place this objective marker inside your own deployment zone. Game effects and control: At the end of the Rally phase: If you have a unit that is within 15 cm of your Cleanse objective marker and closer to it than any enemy units, then you control the objective. Morale effect: At the end of each Rally phase: For each of your Cleanse objectives that you control, add 1 point to your Army Morale value. This objective represents something of particular value to the enemy that you want to destroy to hinder them in some way — a site of strategic or tactical value such as a command bunker, communications relay or missile silo. Placement: You must place this objective marker inside your opponent’s deployment zone. Game effects and control: The bunker objective marker represents a static unit that has these characteristics: Table 1. Bunker data sheet Unit Type Speed Range Firepower Assault Armour Notes Bunker WE 0 cm 0 cm 0 2 6+ Damage Capacity 3 Your goal with this objective is to use shooting and/or assaults to attack and destroy the bunker. Treat the marker as if it were an enemy War Engine unit that is in the Immobilised condition. If it suffers critical damage, it is destroyed, irrespective of any remaining Damage Capacity. In an assault, enemy units that are within 15 cm of the bunker objective marker can lend support during the Assault phase. [TODO: Clarify. My guess is that the intent is for such units to lend support, but not for this alone to cause their detachment to count as engaged in the assault…​ but I’m not sure.] Morale effect: When you destroy your bunker objective, roll a D6 — your opponent must immediately deduct the score from their Army Morale value. Then remove the objective marker from the playing area. This objective represents something of particular one-time value to your army — such as a fuel dump or an ammunition store. When your forces capture it they exploit it immediately and continue with the battle. Placement: You must place this objective in your opponent’s deployment zone. Game effects and control: At the end of the Rally phase: If you have a unit in base contact with your Capture objective marker, then you control this objective. Morale effect: At the end of the Rally phase: For each of your Capture objectives that you control at the end of a turn, choose and apply one of these effects: Capture: Add D6 points to your Army Morale value. Destroy: Your opponent must subtract D6 points from their Army Morale value. Then remove the objective marker from the playing area.

Rather, they hold some elements in reserve, at some distance from the battlefront. This gives them the flexibility to adapt as the battle progresses, to reinforce areas that are weak or to capitalise on a breakthrough. Or sometimes, elements of the available forces may be ready to join a vanguard when it encounters the enemy. Some special rules or scenarios state that you may or must place some of your detachments in Reserves. This means that you will not deploy these detachments before the start of the game. Instead, you will put them into play when they arrive at some point after the start of the game, as we explain below. For convenience, we refer to a detachment that is currently subject to the Reserves rules as a 'Reserves detachment'. During the scenario setup, leave all Reserves detachments out of play. That is, do not deploy them before the game, but instead keep them close at hand to bring into play later. Unless the rules say otherwise, Reserves detachments arrive and go into play as we explain here. We determine the arrival of each Reserves detachment as a function of the Reserve Speed of the detachment, the number of turns you’ve already played, and the roll of a die. A detachment’s Reserve Speed is equal to the Speed value of the slowest unit in the detachment, ignoring units that are embarked in transport units. [1] In the Start phase of each turn, use the Reserves Detachment Arrival table to determine whether or not each Reserves detachment arrives: Roll a D6 for each of your Reserves detachments — the table shows the score you need to trigger the arrival of a given Reserves detachment. Table 1. Reserves Detachment Arrival table Detachment’s Reserve Speed Turn #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 Up to 30 cm - 4+ 4+ 3+ 3+ 2+ Over 30 cm - 3+ 3+ 2+ 2+ 2+ Flyer - 3+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ By default, no Reserves detachment can arrive in the first turn. After that, while you have Reserves detachments that have not entered play, at least one must arrive and enter play each turn. If you roll for all of your detachments and fail to get any die result that would trigger the arrival of a detachment, then your Reserves detachment with the highest Reserve Speed will arrive. If you have multiple detachments that tie for the highest Reserve Speed, then select one of these at random. When your Reserves detachments arrive, they enter play anywhere along the table edge that lies inside your deployment zone. Place the detachment’s HQ unit on this table edge. This shows the point at which units from that detachment will enter play. If you want multiple arrived Reserves detachments to enter play at the same point — along a road, perhaps — simply place their HQ units in a column at that point. In the Movement phase, measure movement for all units from the point on the table edge that the HQ unit identifies — not from the HQ unit itself! 1. To be clear, where you have a detachment that is transporting another detachment, treat them as a single detachment for the sake of arrival — and ignore the cargo units when you determine the Reserve Speed.","title":"Reserves","component":"battles","version":"","name":"reserves","url":"/battles/scenario-special-rules/reserves.html","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Play","hash":"_play","id":2},{"text":"Arrival of Reserves detachments","hash":"_arrival_of_reserves_detachments","id":3},{"text":"Putting arrived Reserves detachments into play","hash":"_putting_arrived_reserves_detachments_into_play","id":4}]},"226":{"id":226,"text":"These rules cover unusual situations that apply in some scenarios and not in others.

Long deployment edge Figure 2. Short deployment edge Figure 3. Corner deployment edge Set up terrain in the standard way. Determine which player gets to choose their deployment edge/zone in the standard way. That player must then choose the deployment edge/zone that they prefer, and their opponent gets the opposite edge/zone (see Maps). Choose your objectives, as follows: Each player must have one objective per 500 points in their army (round fractions up). You may each choose up to one Rescue objective — the rest must all be Take & Hold. Example 1. Number of objectives In a game with a limit of 1,800 points for each army, you will each have four objectives. Place your objective markers in the standard way. Determine the disposition of your forces. Place all of your Flyer detachments in Reserves. If you have any detachments that qualify for the Reserves rules on their own merit, place them in Reserves. Keep all of your other detachments at hand for your initial deployment. Do not deploy any detachments yet. Instead, place HQ units to indicate where the detachments you kept at hand for initial deployment will enter play during the first turn of the game. Start with the player whose army has the lower Strategy Rating and alternate between you until there are no more HQ units to place: Pick an HQ unit to be first, and place it to indicate any point along your deployment edge. Each other HQ unit you place must indicate a point that is on your deployment edge and within 15 cm of the point that your first HQ unit indicates. You may 'stack' multiple HQ units in a column, to indicate the same point on your deployment edge — you might want to do this where a road crosses the table edge, for example. Each player may choose one detachment per 1,000 points of the maximum points value limit (or part thereof — round up) to be a flanking detachment, if they wish. You may place the HQ units of your flanking detachments to indicate any point along your deployment edge, rather than only within 15 cm of the point you indicated with the first HQ unit you placed. Start the game in the usual way: Proceed to the Start phase. When you reach the first Movement phase and it is your turn to complete your moves, put into play the detachments that correspond to the HQ units you placed. Each time you put a detachment into play, measure the movement of its units — including its HQ unit — from the point that its HQ unit indicates on your deployment edge. Aside from Reserves detachments, any detachment that does not enter play in the first turn counts as destroyed — deduct the detachment’s Morale value from your Army Morale total, as normal for a destroyed detachment. [1] [2] Standard Army Morale win conditions apply: At the end of the Rally phase, if a player has an Army Morale value of zero or less then the game ends and the other player is the winner. [3] If this hasn’t happened by the end of the 4th turn, then the player with the higher Army Morale value wins a 'tactical victory'. Or, if you both agree, you could play for as many turns as it takes until a player’s Army Morale value drops to 0. Either way, if both players' Army Morale values drop to 0 or less on the same turn, then the player with the higher Army Morale value wins a 'tactical victory'. 1. We consider the detachment to be 'destroyed' for the sake of the battle, but not for the war. That is, treat the detachment as destroyed for all rules purposes in the current game — but not for future games, if you’re playing a campaign. 2. Difference from Epic 40,000: The original text for this scenario is ambiguous as it merely states that such detachments 'are lost'. We’ve defined consequences that are consistent with other unusual but similar situations that we’ve defined elsewhere. 3. Difference from Epic 40,000: In a strict interpretation of the original text for this scenario, you might end the game as soon as a player’s Army Morale value reaches 0, whenever that happens during a game turn.

Difference from Epic 40,000: In the original Battles book, this scenario details a random method by which the Attacker must determine most of their initial ambush force. However, the designers found that this tends to put the Attacker at too great a disadvantage.

This scenario does not lend itself well to a randomised approach in which you choose balanced armies in advance and then randomise which army will attack and which will defend.

[1] Non-standard deployment edges: After the Defender completes their initial deployment in their deployment zone, the Attacker chooses a deployment edge that they will use to bring their Reserves into play. The Defender then gets all remaining edges to bring their Reserves into play. The Defender’s deployment zone covers the entire table, except within 15 cm of each table edge. The Attacker has no deployment zone, only the deployment edge that they choose after the Defender completes their initial deployment. Figure 1. Long deployment edge Figure 2.

Either choose from among those available, or pick at random. Defender: You must have one objective per 1,000 points in your army (round fractions down). You may use only Cleanse objectives. Example 1. Number of objectives In a 1,500 point game, the Attacker will have three objectives and the Defender will have one. Place your objective markers. The Attacker must place one of their objective markers first, then alternate until both players have have placed all of their objective markers. Attacker: Determine the disposition of your forces. You may do this after you see the defender’s initial deployment, if you wish. [2] Split your army into two parts, to represent two separate assault waves: The part that represents the first assault wave must contain all of your army’s Flyer detachments, and may contain any other detachments. This part is available for you to deploy in the first turn of the game — but you may only bring troops in this part into play if they are transported by Flyer transport units, or if they are valid Drop Pods detachments. [TODO: Clarify: Exactly what does the term 'troops' mean here? The natural assumption is that it means Infantry units, but it seems like it should actually mean all valid 'cargo' units — which can include Vehicle units in some cases (and could potentially include specific War Engine units in this project in due course)? What if this part includes units that don’t qualify and must be left behind? Should we apply a note like that in Meeting Engagement about counting them as destroyed, or should we reformat the instructions so that this can’t happen, or…​ something else?] [TODO: Clarify: What about other detachments that qualify for the Reserves rules on their own merit, aside from Drop Pods? I seem to recall text somewhere that states something to the effect that \"Tunnellers don’t count as Drop Pods for the Planetary Assault scenario\" — but should any other detachments count, through the Deep Strike ability or whatever?] The part that represents the second assault wave contains all the rest of detachments in your army. (We assume that the attacking army landed these detachments in the nearby landing zone in light orbital transports that they didn’t want to risk in a 'hot' landing zone.) Place all detachments in this part in Reserves, to enter play under the normal Reserves rules. [TODO: Clarify: Is there any minimum requirement for the second assault wave, such as at least one detachment?

Aside from the above, roll a D6 for each detachment in your army: 1 to 3: This detachment is part of your reinforcements — place it in Reserves. 4 to 6: This detachment is part of your immediate defences. If it is a Flyer detachment, place it aside ready to bring into play in the first turn of the game. If it is an Infantry and/or Vehicle detachment, keep it at hand for your initial deployment. [TODO: What if it is a detachment that qualifies for the Reserves rules on it’s own merit? Place it aside ready to bring into play in the first turn of the game?] You must deploy at least one detachment during initial deployment. So, if you did not roll 4 to 6 for any of your non-Flyer detachments then you must randomly determine one detachment to keep at hand for this purpose. Defender: You must deploy first. Deploy within the Defender’s deployment zone D (see Maps). Use the Hidden Setup rules to deploy all of the detachments that you kept at hand for your initial deployment. You may also use Fortifications if you wish. Attacker: Choose a deployment edge (see Maps). This represents the proximity of your army’s primary landing zone, and is where you can bring your Reserves detachments into play later. The Defender may use any or all of the other edges to bring their Reserves detachments into play later. Attacker: You have no initial deployment — all your forces arrive in the first turn or later (see Disposition of forces). Start the game in the usual way: Proceed to the Start phase. Defender: In the first turn only, when any of your hidden detachments are revealed, roll a D6: 1 to 3: The attackers surprise this detachment, and it is now in disarray. Place an Order marker to indicate that it is subject to the Broken condition. (The standard rules apply, so you can try to rally the detachment in the Rally phase). 4 to 6: The detachment is alert and ready for battle. You may use it as normal. Standard Army Morale win conditions apply: At the end of the Rally phase, if a player has an Army Morale value of zero or less then the game ends and the other player is the winner.

The Defender scores 1 victory point for each other objective that the Attacker did not achieve during the game. The player with the most victory points is the winner. 1. Difference from Epic 40,000: In the original text, it’s not entirely clear whether or not the corner deployment edge option was intended. There’s an ambiguous use of the phrase \"single table edge\" which could imply only actual physical table edges (long or short), as opposed to a conceptual deployment edge (long, short, or corner). We don’t think it matters though, so we decided to include the corner option rather that rule it out. 2. This probably doesn’t really matter, but the order of the steps in Epic 40,000 implies that this is the case — so we provide the option. 3. Difference from Epic 40,000: In a strict interpretation of the original text for this scenario, you might end the game as soon as a player’s Army Morale value reaches 0, whenever that happens during a game turn.

We have made no attempt to include instructions for more general usage. However, for ideas to vary this scenario, see Scenario variants. Essential terrain Roads that converge at a 'Y' junction in the centre of the playing area. Seven areas of ruins, close to the roads. Deployment The Attacker has no deployment edge. The Defender has a fixed deployment edge. Fixed deployment zones — refer to the map. Legend A Attacker’s deployment zone. D Defender’s deployment zone (approximate — actually defined by Initial deployment). Set up terrain as we show at Maps. You may set up further terrain as you agree between you. Decide which player will be the Attacker (Orks) and which the Defender (Space Marines). Place objectives: Attacker: You do not set up any objectives for this scenario — the Defender places markers for your objectives. Defender: You have no objectives of your own, but you must place markers for two Bunker objectives that will be the focus of your opponent’s attack. You may place these anywhere in the playing area that is at least 15 cm away from any table edge. Attacker: Determine the disposition of your forces. Keep your detachment (gargant) at hand for your initial deployment. Defender: Determine the disposition of your forces. Choose one detachment to be in position near the 'Y' junction at the start of the battle. Keep this force at hand for initial deployment. Keep your other detachments at hand for deployment in your first turn. Defender: Deploy the detachment that you kept at hand for initial deployment. You must deploy the units so that they are in, or in base contact with, the ruins that are adjacent to the 'Y' junction (see Maps). Defender: Do not deploy your remaining detachments yet. Instead, place their HQ units anywhere along your deployment edge (on the roads if you like) to indicate where these detachments will enter play during the first turn of the game. Attacker: Deploy your detachment (gargant) anywhere within the Attacker’s deployment zone A (see Maps). Start Start the game in the usual way: Proceed to the Start phase. Reinforcements Defender: When you reach the first Movement phase and it is your turn to complete your moves, put into play the detachments that correspond to the HQ units you placed. Each time you put a detachment into play, measure the movement of its units — including its HQ unit — from the point that its HQ unit indicates on your deployment edge. New krew The gargant has a new krew of lowly Gretchin riggers — Gogard used the old krew for target practice after a very poor performance in the most recent battle. This new krew are a bit slow to implement the orders that Gogard blares at them…​ In the Movement and Assault phases, the Defender always wins the Initiative. [TODO: Clarify — presumably we should still remove the Defender’s Initiative token from the mug?] Bunker objectives When a Bunker objective marker comes under attack, treat it as an Immobilised War Engine unit with the following profile: Table 1. Bunker data sheet Unit Type Speed Range Firepower Assault Armour Notes Bunker WE 0 cm 0 cm 0 2 6+ Damage Capacity 3 Play until either the Ork Gargant is destroyed or both Bunker objectives are destroyed. If the Defender destroys the Gargant before it has destroyed either bunker, then they win immediately. If the Attacker destroys both Bunker objectives, then they win immediately. If the Attacker destroys just one Bunker objective and then their Gargant is destroyed, then the game is a draw. Ork Gargants detachment 1 x Great Gargant (Korps Grinda).

Ready-made army roster in the Detachment Builder Imperium army detachments for Refight 1 This scenario is meant to introduce you to the core rules, and just a few special rules (including those for War Engine units). So it is quite straightforward, and includes only a small number of units. You might like to play it a few times before you get into anything more complex. Even so, you might like to change things a bit to keep it interesting — so, here are some ideas for variants to try: Swap the Defender’s heavy weapons infantry for more tanks: Simply drop Force Adonis and add another armoured detachment like Force Citus instead. Swap the Defender’s tanks for more heavy weapons infantry: Simply drop Force Citus and add another detachment like Force Adonis instead. The defending Imperial force could’ve been very different. Create a different defending force, which will likely present much more of a challenge for the Attacker: The Defender may use the Imperial army list to build an army of up to 500 points. Gogard’s gargant was barely operational when it attacked the Imperial positions. If it had broken down before it arrived for this battle, then Gogard would have had to cobble together a different force of Orks to attack with.

Otherwise, for more general use of this scenario: With your opponent, agree a maximum points value limit for the battle. Then build your army within this limit. Be mindful that armies that field a lot of fast-moving transport vehicles — especially transport flyers, skimmers and fast attack vehicles — are apt to unbalance this scenario. Therefore, we recommend that you and your opponent agree to limit such units in your army builds for this scenario. The map and dimensions in the original Epic 40,000 rules content are ambiguous and incompatible with the 180 cm length of the standard playing area. This implies that the designers intended a larger-than-usual playing area for this scenario. So, we present two different layouts for you to choose from — one with the original dimensions for use with a larger playing area, and one with dimensions we suggest to suit the standard-sized playing area. Fixed deployment edges and zones — refer to the maps. Figure 1. Original dimensions (recommended): Requires larger playing area (240x120 cm) Figure 2. Compressed dimensions (alternative): To suit the standard-sized playing area (180x120 cm) Legend A Attacker’s deployment zone. D Defender’s garrison deployment zone. Set up terrain in the standard way. Decide at random which player will be the Attacker and which the Defender. Choose your objectives, as follows: Attacker: You have no objectives of your own. Instead, your mission is to interfere with the Defender’s rescue mission (see Game length and victory conditions). Defender: You have a single Rescue objective. Defender: Place your Rescue objective marker anywhere within the Defender’s garrison deployment zone D (see Maps). Usually, you may only make the initial pick-up of a Rescue objective if it is your objective. For this scenario, if the Defender’s forces have not picked up the Rescue objective and the Attacker’s forces reach a position where they could otherwise make the initial pick-up, then they may do so. [TODO: Clarify whether or not (and how) the Defender may choose to transfer the Rescue objective from one unit to another. The Defender might want or need to transfer the objective from a garrison unit that picked it up initially to another unit, perhaps to one in a relief force detachment. I think that the tactical suggestions, and practicalities of the distance to cover within 6 turns for a successful rescue, imply that this should be allowed — but as far as I can recall, the rules don’t actually make it explicit anywhere. Probably we should clarify this as a general thing in the Rescue objective rules first, and then add a reminder somewhere in this scenario.] Attacker: Determine the disposition of your forces. Place all of your Flyer detachments in Reserves. If you have any detachments that qualify for the Reserves rules on their own merit, place them in Reserves. Keep all of your other detachments at hand for your initial deployment. Defender: Determine the disposition of your forces. Place all of your Flyer detachments in Reserves. If you have any detachments that qualify for the Reserves rules on their own merit, place them in Reserves. Choose detachments up to a total of a quarter of your army’s maximum points value limit as the garrison force that protects the vital assassin. You may only use complete detachments in the garrison force. Keep this force at hand for initial deployment. The remainder of your detachments form your relief force. Keep this force at hand for initial deployment. Defender: Deploy all of the detachments of your garrison force. Deploy within the Defender’s garrison deployment zone D (see Maps). Attacker: Deploy all of the detachments that you kept at hand for your initial deployment. Defender: Do not deploy any detachments yet. Instead, place HQ units to indicate where the detachments you kept at hand for the relief force will enter play during the first turn of the game. Pick an HQ unit to be first, and place it to indicate any point along your deployment edge. Each other HQ unit you place must indicate a point that is on your deployment edge and within 15 cm of the point that your first HQ unit indicates. You may 'stack' multiple HQ units in a column, to indicate the same point on your deployment edge — you might want to do this where a road crosses the table edge, for example. Each player may choose one detachment per 1,000 points of the maximum points value limit (or part thereof — round up) to be a flanking detachment, if they wish. You may place the HQ units of your flanking detachments to indicate any point along your deployment edge, rather than only within 15 cm of the point you indicated with the first HQ unit you placed. Start Start the game in the usual way: Proceed to the Start phase. Reserves Attacker: You may bring your Reserves detachments into play anywhere along ????. [TODO: The original version of this scenario made no accommodation for Reserves. Can we integrate them sensibly, so we can include aircraft and whatnot? In particular, where should the Attacker’s Reserves detachments enter play?] Defender: If you have any Reserves detachments then, as they arrive, bring them into play anywhere along your deployment edge (see Maps). To win this scenario, the Defender must exit the Rescue objective marker off of the Defender’s deployment edge by the end of Turn 6. If the Defender has control of the objective marker but hasn’t moved it off of the play area by the end of Turn 6, then the result is a draw. If the Attacker has control of the objective marker at the end of any turn then they win immediately. Any other result is a draw.

Ready-made army roster in the Detachment Builder Imperium army detachments for Refight 2 You have two extremes to consider: Use the bulk of your army to engage and stall the Defender’s relief force; and use a smaller force with which you will attempt to pry the assassin loose of her garrison bodyguards. If you can stabilise the rearward situation, then you may be able to redirect part of your rearguard to overwhelm the garrison. OR Use as much of your army as possible to attack the garrison at the outset; in effect, fight on a single front in the hope that you can overwhelm the garrison and secure the objective before the Defender’s relief force can do enough to stop you in a two-front fight. Your garrison force needs to be able to hold its own until your relief force can help it. You should probably consider a mix of infantry equipped with heavy weapons, and tough assault units. Deploy the heavy weapons infantry with a good view of the enemy approach, and put them on Overwatch orders. Surround the Rescue objective marker with the best all-round infantry you have (effectively, bodyguards for the assassin). Some good examples include Space Marine Terminators, Imperial Ogryns, Ork Nobz, and similarly powerful infantry units. Be mindful of enemy Barrage weapons — if you pack your garrison units too tightly then you’ll suffer extra casualties from enemy artillery, that you could’ve avoided. Or, you might consider a fast-moving garrison force, with the hope that you can pierce the Attacker’s battle line and break through to join up with your relief force. For this to work, your garrison force must be able to move very fast, and you’ll need to time your break-through attempt carefully. Otherwise, you’ll find your garrison force overwhelmed by the superior attacking force before your relief force can affect the outcome. For your relief force, you’ll probably do best if you consider it in two parts: Engagement: A general range of tanks, artillery and war engines to engage and destroy enemy detachments — or at least keep them busy while your other forces complete the rescue operation. Rescue: Some fast but hard-hitting units that you can use to give direct aid to the garrison force — either to force their way through to effect the rescue themselves, or to assist a break-through by the garrison force. Of course your opponent knows that they must deal with an attack from rearward, and will plan for this. Nonetheless, this is a big disadvantage for them. To exploit this to best effect, work out which enemy detachments your opponent will likely use to spearhead the assault on your garrison force and prioritise these for attack. The more pressure you can take off of your garrison force, the better. Ideally, if you can catch the enemy spearhead troops with your own assault troops in your relief force, do so. The resulting combat is likely to be more disruptive to your opponent’s plans, in comparison to shooting. Those you can’t catch, weaken with your long-range firepower and super-heavy weapons. Remember, your goal is to rescue the assassin (extract the Rescue objective marker) — don’t let tempting targets distract you from higher-priority activities that have more bearing on the success of your mission.","title":"Refight 2: Rescue","component":"battles","version":"","name":"refight-2-rescue","url":"/battles/scenarios/refight-2-rescue.html","titles":[{"text":"Narrative background","hash":"_narrative_background","id":1},{"text":"Scenario special rules","hash":"_scenario_special_rules","id":2},{"text":"Armies","hash":"_armies","id":3},{"text":"Maps","hash":"_maps","id":4},{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":5},{"text":"Disposition of forces","hash":"_disposition_of_forces","id":6},{"text":"Initial deployment","hash":"_initial_deployment","id":7},{"text":"Play the game","hash":"_play_the_game","id":8},{"text":"Game length and victory conditions","hash":"_game_length_and_victory_conditions","id":9},{"text":"Historical forces","hash":"_historical_forces","id":10},{"text":"Orks army","hash":"_orks_army","id":11},{"text":"Space Marines army","hash":"_space_marines_army","id":12},{"text":"Tactics","hash":"_tactics","id":13},{"text":"Attacker’s tactics","hash":"_attackers_tactics","id":14},{"text":"Defender’s tactics","hash":"_defenders_tactics","id":15}]},"236":{"id":236,"text":"This is just a summary.

Otherwise, for more general use of this scenario: With your opponent, agree a maximum points value limit for the battle. Then build your army within this limit. Essential terrain Two areas of foothills, each flanking the Defender’s side of the playing area. Deployment Fixed deployment edges and zones — refer to the map. The Attacker has two possible edges for 'flanking deployment', one adjacent to each area of foothills. [1] Legend A Attacker’s deployment zone. D Defender’s deployment zone. L Attacker’s left flanking edge. R Attacker’s right flanking edge. Place two areas of foothills, as we show at Maps. These represent the lower slopes of a mountain chain. Use any mountainous or rocky terrain that you have in your terrain collection. Or, if you lack suitable items, you could use hills and woods instead. Just try to make the terrain in the two areas of foothills quite dense and hilly, but still passable for ground units. Set up terrain in the rest of the playing area in the standard way. Determine at random which player will be the Attacker and which the Defender. Choose your objectives, as follows: Attacker: You must have one objective per 500 points in your army (round fractions up). You may use any objectives, except for Rescue and Cleanse. You may either choose from among those available, or pick at random. Defender: You must have one objective per 1,000 points in your army (rounding fractions down). You may use only Cleanse objectives. Example 1. Number of objectives In a 1,500 point game, the Attacker will have three objectives and the Defender will have one. Place your objective markers. The Attacker must place the first objective marker and then the players alternate until they have placed all of the objective markers. Attacker: Determine the disposition of your forces. Place all of your Flyer detachments in Reserves. If you have any detachments that qualify for the Reserves rules on their own merit, place them in Reserves. Set aside up to a quarter of your army’s maximum points value limit as a flanking force. You may only use complete detachments in the flanking force. You will put this force into play in the second turn of the game. Keep all of your other detachments at hand for your initial deployment. Defender: Determine the disposition of your forces. Place all of your Flyer detachments in Reserves. If you have any detachments that qualify for the Reserves rules on their own merit, place them in Reserves. Keep all of your other detachments at hand for your initial deployment. Attacker: In secret, make a note that states which one of the two possible flanking edges your flanking force will arrive on — left L, or right R. Defender: Deploy all of the detachments that you kept at hand for your initial deployment. Deploy within the Defender’s deployment zone D (see Maps). You may also use Fortifications if you wish. To be clear, the Defender may place units in either or both of the two areas of foothills. Attacker: Deploy within the Attacker’s deployment zone A (see Maps). Start Start the game in the usual way: Proceed to the Start phase. Flanking force Attacker: When you reach the Start phase of the second turn, your flanking force arrives. Reveal your secret note which states which flanking edge you will use. Place the HQ unit of each detachment you have in the flanking force to identify a point on that edge, to indicate where the corresponding detachment will enter play. When you reach the Movement phase of the second turn, and it is your turn to complete your moves, put your flanking detachments into play. Each time you put a flanking detachment into play, measure the movement of its units — including its HQ unit — from the point that its HQ unit indicates on your flanking edge. The flanking force catches the defenders by surprise — the Defender may not use the Snap Fire rule against units of the Attacker’s flanking force on the turn that it arrives. Bringing Reserves detachments into play If you have any Reserves detachments then, as they arrive, bring them into play anywhere along your deployment edge (see Maps). Standard Army Morale win conditions apply: At the end of the Rally phase, if a player has an Army Morale value of zero or less then the game ends and the other player is the winner. [2] If this hasn’t happened by the end of the 5th turn, or if both players' Army Morale values drop to 0 or less on the same turn, then the player with the highest Army Morale value is the winner.

Ready-made army roster in the Detachment Builder Imperium army detachments for Refight 3 At the start of the game, the Defender has their entire army in the playing area, while the Attacker does not. The Defender must capitalise on this early advantage as much as possible, before the Attacker’s flanking force arrives in the second turn. The Attacker has a golden opportunity to strike at detachments that might otherwise be difficult to reach, especially if they have a relatively slow-moving army. The larger you make your flanking force, the weaker the main force you’ll deploy and then manoeuvre in the first turn. But, a faint heart won’t win the day: With a strong flanking force, a good battle plan, and the benefit of knowledge that your opponent lacks (that is, you know which flank you’ll attack) you have the chance to inflict some crushing casualties. Note that your flanking force gives you a golden opportunity to put slow-moving but powerful units close to the enemy without a long slog across the battlefield under fire. This has obvious benefit for the less-mobile armies, such as the Imperial Guard. But, even the likes of Space Marines have some slow units and allied support options — and you can’t fit a titan in a Thunderhawk Gunship! Think of the mayhem you could cause with a company of Baneblade super-heavy tanks supported by infantry…​ or a horde of Goff Orks…​ or a Chaos Greater Daemon with a retinue of Lesser Daemons…​ In any case, whatever the size and composition of your flanking force, it gives you the advantage of knowledge that your opponent doesn’t have. In the early stages of the battle, your opponent is forced to be somewhat conservative and reactive. In general, the flank attack is less of a worry for a Defender who has a highly mobile army, and more of a worry for a Defender who has slow-moving army. And the flank attack might present a more valuable opportunity for an Attacker who has a slow-moving army rather than a highly mobile army. So, as the Defender, what can you do? You know for certain that there will be a flank attack, you know when, and you know the maximum strength it could be (in terms of points value). You just don’t know the exact strength or composition of the force. No matter what army you command, the one thing you can’t do is ignore the flanking force. Things to consider include: Make sure that by the end of Turn 1, you’ve positioned Infantry units to protect any vulnerable Vehicle units. Position detachments of close combat specialists such that they will be ready to counter attack or take cover if the flanking force has a lot of firepower. Where you don’t have a better plan, make use of Overwatch orders to make your detachments more dangerous to approach. You know that one of your flanks will face the flanking force while the other will be relatively secure. Have a plan for what you’ll do once you know whether it is your left or right flank that faces the flanking force, and then implement your plan from Turn 2 onwards. 1. Difference from Epic 40,000: The original Epic 40,000 content is ambiguous about the exact extent of these edges. We indicate the extent that we think is the most sensible. 2. Difference from Epic 40,000: In a strict interpretation of the original text for this scenario, you might end the game as soon as a player’s Army Morale value reaches 0, whenever that happens during a game turn. However, we think it is more consistent with other rules, more fair, and probably the original intent, to complete the turn sequence and determine the overall game state only at step R4. Check the game end conditions, as usual. So, we’ve made the text clear in this respect.","title":"Refight 3: The Hellblade Mountains","component":"battles","version":"","name":"refight-3-the-hellblade-mountains","url":"/battles/scenarios/refight-3-the-hellblade-mountains.html","titles":[{"text":"Narrative background","hash":"_narrative_background","id":1},{"text":"Scenario special rules","hash":"_scenario_special_rules","id":2},{"text":"Armies","hash":"_armies","id":3},{"text":"Maps","hash":"_maps","id":4},{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":5},{"text":"Disposition of forces","hash":"_disposition_of_forces","id":6},{"text":"Initial deployment","hash":"_initial_deployment","id":7},{"text":"Play the game","hash":"_play_the_game","id":8},{"text":"Game length and victory conditions","hash":"_game_length_and_victory_conditions","id":9},{"text":"Historical forces","hash":"_historical_forces","id":10},{"text":"Orks army","hash":"_orks_army","id":11},{"text":"Space Marines army","hash":"_space_marines_army","id":12},{"text":"Tactics","hash":"_tactics","id":13},{"text":"Attacker’s tactics","hash":"_attackers_tactics","id":14},{"text":"Defender’s tactics","hash":"_defenders_tactics","id":15}]},"237":{"id":237,"text":"This is just a summary.

For a simple variation that can represent other historical battles, if both players agree, simply allow the Space Marines to use drop pods to deploy (see Drop Pods). [TODO: Clarify: This variation doesn’t really seem to make sense with the given historical forces, as each of the Space Marine detachments includes Vehicle units that the rules do not normally allow for drop pods (and not just Rhino transport vehicles, which are the usual 'trade' for drop pods — there’s also 5 Land Raiders, and 6 Whirlwinds that comprise an entire detachment). Should we ignore the usual restrictions and allow such units in the historical force to deploy via drop pods alongside the rest for this scenario?

Otherwise, for more general use of this scenario: With your opponent, agree a maximum points value limit for the battle. Then build your army within this limit. Be mindful that attacking armies that are able to field a lot of fast-moving transport vehicles, transport flyers and fast attack vehicles — as with Space Marines — are apt to unbalance this scenario. Therefore, we recommend that for the attacking army you limit the number of transport flyers (such as Thunderhawk Gunship units carrying Space Marines units), or ban them altogether. Remember that the game is supposed to be challenging and fun for both players — not a one-sided stomp-fest. Conversely, if your playing area is more than the standard 120 cm deep, the attacking army may struggle to cross it in time — so in that case, we suggest that you increase the game length by one turn for every additional 30 cm of depth. [TODO: Clarify: I’d argue that this logic should apply not only for playing areas that are physically larger, but also for the greater distances that result from short-edge deployment and corner deployment options on a standard-sized playing area.] Standard deployment edges. The Attacker’s deployment zone extends from their deployment edge to 20 cm onto the playing area. The Defender’s deployment zone extends from their deployment edge to the half-way line. Figure 1.

Determine at random which player will be the Attacker and which the Defender. Defender: Choose which table edge you prefer as the basis for your deployment. Your opponent gets the opposite table edge. See Maps. Attacker: Determine the disposition of your forces. Place all of your Flyer detachments in Reserves. If you have any detachments that qualify for the Reserves rules on their own merit, place them in Reserves. Keep all of your other detachments at hand for your initial deployment. Defender: Determine the disposition of your forces. You will have only half of the strength of your army for this battle. Choose the detachments that will form your defensive force. The total points value of this force must be no more than half of the maximum points value limit for this battle. You must choose complete detachments. [TODO: Clarify: If the Defender chooses any Flyer detachments, should they place them aside to bring into play in the first turn, or should they place them in Reserves?] Keep the detachments you choose at hand for your initial deployment. The rest of your army does not take part in this battle. [TODO: Clarify: Why not simply have the Defender choose a smaller army in the first place? This scenario seems to be rather an oddity as I work to remaster it — in general, the original texts that pertain to scenarios imply that we should determine the scenario to play first and then build our armies, but this scenario implies the opposite (given that it instructs the Defender to use only half of their army)…​] Defender: You must deploy first. Use the Hidden Setup rules to deploy all of the detachments that you kept at hand for your initial deployment. Deploy within the Defender’s deployment zone D (see Maps). You may also use Fortifications if you wish. Although you have use of only half your army, you still get one Hidden Setup marker for each Infantry and/or Vehicle detachment that exists in your full army. [TODO: Clarify: The original version of this scenario seems to have been written with no thought to Flyer or War Engine detachments. Should we explicitly exclude them, or should we make proper allowance for either or both of these types of detachment? If the latter, are there game balance issues to account for? How do Flyer detachments affect the number of ground-based detachments the Attacker must exit off of the Defender’s table edge for a win? (Probably they shouldn’t affect this at all, so the Attacker must be mindful that an excess of Flyer detachments could be a hindrance.)] Attacker: Deploy all of the detachments that you kept at hand for initial deployment. Deploy within the Attacker’s deployment zone A (see Maps). When your Reserves detachments arrive, you may bring them into play anywhere along the Attacker’s deployment edge. Start Start the game in the usual way: Proceed to the Start phase. Bringing Reserves detachments into play If you have any Reserves detachments then, as they arrive, bring them into play anywhere along your deployment edge (see Maps). To win this scenario, the Attacker must exit at least half of the detachments in their army off of the Defender’s table edge by the end of Turn 6. Detachments reduced to half strength or less do not count. [TODO: For an odd number of attacking detachments, should we round up or round down for the number that must exit for a win…​?] Any other result is a win for the Defender.

Ready-made army roster in the Detachment Builder Imperium army detachments for Refight 5 The role of the Attacker is perhaps a bit easier than that of the Defender. So, the Attacker’s tactical considerations are more straightforward. There’s still plenty to think about in each role though. You’ll probably be tempted to invest all of your available points on fast units — including transport vehicles for as much of your infantry as possible — and then use March and Assault orders to rush them across the playing area. On the one hand, if you over-do this with a highly mobile army it can seriously unbalance this scenario. On the other hand, you should be mindful that troop transports offer your opponent the opportunity to increase the overall effect of their shooting — each hit they get on a transport vehicle may also cause hits on the embarked cargo units. So, consider a more balanced approach: If you include some slower detachments that have powerful ranged units, you can put these on Overwatch orders (or at least Advance orders, rather than March or Assault orders) and lay down strong covering fire. This makes for a more interesting game and still affords you a number of benefits: It will help to off-set the lack of firepower from the detachments that you’re rushing forward on March or Assault orders, and ensure that the Defender doesn’t completely dominate the Shooting phase. It forces the Defender to be more cautious with their positioning, as they must be mindful of incoming fire. It suppresses enemy fire, so your assault detachments suffer fewer casualties as they close with the enemy. The casualties you cause and the Blast markers you place on enemy detachments shift the odds more in your favour for your assaults. Remember that you only need to exit half of your detachments off of the Defender’s table edge to win — so you can afford to use some detachments as disposable forces in rearguard actions, to provide covering fire for the rest of your army. This is especially true for armies that tend to be slow overall, such as those chiefly comprised of Imperial Guard units. An artillery company or battle titan can provide a lot of supporting fire to pound enemy positions and thereby reduce the pressure on the slow-moving detachments as they creep across the battlefield. Plan to move your detachments off of the escape edge in strength. That is, don’t move your escaping detachments off piecemeal over several turns — if you do this, you’ll give your opponent the opportunity to concentrate their shooting on the units that are most likely to escape each turn. That would make it much easier for your opponent to reduce enough of your detachments to half-strength that you can’t achieve your victory conditions. A lot depends on the terrain setup. If the terrain is more dense near one side of the table, then that’s probably the side you should choose. You should seek to maximise cover for your units and to minimise cover that your opponent can use to shield their units from your shooting. And, remember that you can use hills and buildings to gain better fields of fire for your units. [TODO: Perhaps comment on effective use of fortifications and hidden setup.] When you build and deploy your army, be mindful that you need to be able quickly reinforce either flank. A canny opponent will likely strike not on a broad front but at one flank of your battle line, seeking to break through before you can bring reinforcements to bear from the other flank. You should make good use of long-ranged gunnery that can cover a lot of ground and slow the enemy, and fast, powerful assault units that can redeploy quickly and hit hard where they are needed. In general, you should: Position the bulk of your infantry relatively close to your table edge — within 30 cm perhaps — and give them Overwatch orders. Position your close-combat specialists much closer to the half-way line, so that you can threaten enemy detachments with an assault in the first turn of the game. Target the fastest-moving enemy units first. Remember that attack is the best form of defence, and that it pays to concentrate your attacks. Prioritise, and focus on breaking a small number of enemy detachments at a time — don’t get distracted by fresh targets that tempt you to divide your fire! Once you’ve reduced a given enemy detachment to half strength, it becomes a low-priority target as it is no longer valid for the Attacker’s victory conditions. Shift your focus to another detachment that is still above half strength. If you repeat this scenario with much the same army in both the Attacker and Defender roles, you’ll likely find that an army that fares badly in attack tends to do well in defence, and vice versa.","title":"Refight 5: Breakout","component":"battles","version":"","name":"refight-5-breakout","url":"/battles/scenarios/refight-5-breakout.html","titles":[{"text":"Narrative background","hash":"_narrative_background","id":1},{"text":"Scenario special rules","hash":"_scenario_special_rules","id":2},{"text":"Armies","hash":"_armies","id":3},{"text":"Maps","hash":"_maps","id":4},{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":5},{"text":"Disposition of forces","hash":"_disposition_of_forces","id":6},{"text":"Initial deployment","hash":"_initial_deployment","id":7},{"text":"Play the game","hash":"_play_the_game","id":8},{"text":"Game length and victory conditions","hash":"_game_length_and_victory_conditions","id":9},{"text":"Historical forces","hash":"_historical_forces","id":10},{"text":"Ork army","hash":"_ork_army","id":11},{"text":"Space Marine army","hash":"_space_marine_army","id":12},{"text":"Tactics","hash":"_tactics","id":13},{"text":"Attacker’s tactics","hash":"_attackers_tactics","id":14},{"text":"Defender’s tactics","hash":"_defenders_tactics","id":15}]},"239":{"id":239,"text":"These rules give you step-by-step instructions for how to set up and play battles of many different types.

Neither commander knows the size or goals of the opposing force. All they know is the size and composition of their own force, and what their high command expects them to achieve. The random nature of the missions in The Fog of War means that some extreme combinations can lead to very short or unbalanced games. Several of the missions can also be difficult for armies that are especially slow-moving. But, much of the point of The Fog of War is to put a genuine element of the unknown into games, and to encourage you to work with what you have. A good way to approach this is to play two or three The Fog of War battles in one session, to give things a chance to even out. The Fog of War can also be useful for campaigns: Use it as-is, to generate some randomised scenarios in your campaign. Use the missions as inspiration for your own scenarios. Arrange battles such that each player must allocate their forces between several different missions. Objectives; Reserves — note that this scenario modifies the usual rules for arrival of Reserves, as we describe at Reserves detachments arrival (modified) You will also need a pack of ordinary playing cards. With your opponent, agree a maximum points value limit for the battle. Then build your army within this limit. The original Epic 40,000 texts are ambiguous and it’s not clear exactly what 'edges' we should use for Reserves in this scenario. We have not yet settled on a particular interpretation, so there’s a good chance that we’ll change some of the details that you see here. Non-standard deployment edges — refer to the map. The two deployment zones represent the areas that opposing detachments are patrolling at the moment they sight each other. The deployment zones are in opposite corners of the playing area, 150 cm apart. Each is 90 cm deep, with a width that depends upon the width of your playing area (15 cm by default). Legend A Deployment zone A. B Deployment zone B. Set up terrain in the standard way. Determine which player gets to choose their deployment edge/zone in the standard way. That player must then choose the deployment edge/zone that they prefer, and their opponent gets the opposite edge/zone (see Maps). Choose your objectives, as follows: Each player must have one Capture, two Take & Hold and one Cleanse objective. Place your objective markers in the standard way. The player whose army has the lower Strategy Rating must one of their objective markers first. Then alternate until both players have have placed all of their objective markers. Determine your mission and the forces that are available to you. Each player must act as follows: Draw a playing card at random. Look at the face of the card, but do not reveal it to your opponent. Find the corresponding entry at Fog of War missions list and familiarise yourself with your mission — and note how much of your army you’ll get (the 'force size'). Place your card aside, face down. Determine the disposition of your forces. Place all of your Flyer detachments in Reserves. Place all of your War Engine detachments in Reserves. Place your Supreme Commander detachment in Reserves. If you have any detachments that you normally must place in Reserves, place them in Reserves. From your remaining detachments, determine one to deploy during initial deployment — this represents your patrol force, the vanguard of your army. This must be the Infantry/Vehicle detachment that has the lowest points value among the remaining detachments in the your army. Keep this vanguard detachment at hand for your initial deployment. To be clear: Even if it is the lowest points value detachment in your army, do not use a Flyer, War Engine or Supreme Commander detachment for your vanguard. Place the rest of your detachments in Reserves. Aside from your vanguard detachment, all of the detachments in your army are now in Reserves. Check your mission’s force size, and decide which of your Reserves detachments you will actually use in your force for this scenario. Some of these steps will seem redundant when you have a small force size — but when you go through the motions anyway, you give your opponent fewer clues about the nature of your mission. The player whose army has the lower Strategy Rating must deploy their vanguard detachment first, in their deployment zone. Then the opposing player must deploy their vanguard detachment in their deployment zone. Start Start the game in the usual way: Proceed to the Start phase. Reserves detachments arrival (modified) The standard rules for arrival of Reserves detachments would reveal to your opponent exactly how many Reserves detachments you have — another major clue about the nature of your mission. So, for this scenario, use these arrival rules instead: You may bring your Reserves detachments into play during the Start phase of each turn after the first. The number of Reserve detachments that you may then bring into play depends on the number of them that you decided to use in your force before the start of the game: Table 1. Fog of War Reserves Arrival table Number of Reserves detachments at the outset Number that you may bring into play each turn 1–5 detachments One per turn 6–10 detachments Up to two per turn 11–15 detachments Up to three per turn …​and so on …​and so on Choose which available Reserves detachments you will put into play. When you put a Reserves detachment into play, proceed as normal — place its HQ unit to indicate a point on your deployment edge, and move the detachment into play from this point during the Movement phase. Discovering your opponent’s mission During the course of the game, you may be able to discover the nature of your opponent’s secret mission. There are two ways that this can happen (aside from your own guesswork based on your opponent’s behaviour of course): tactical analysis and psychic precognition. — Tactical analysis Observation of the enemy forces, tactics and movement can give you a general idea of their objectives. The longer the engagement goes on, the easier it becomes to work out just what the foe is up to. At the end of each Rally phase, roll a D6 and consult the table below; if you get the required score then your opponent must reveal their mission. Table 2. Fog of War Tactical Analysis table Turn 1 2 3 4 5 Score required on D6 6+ 5+ 4+ 3+ 2+ If your Supreme Commander unit is in the playing area, then you may re-roll the die. — Psychic precognition Psykers can often pick up fragments of information, impressions of the potential future and of what enemy plans may be. At the end of each Rally phase, roll a D6 for every Psyker unit that you have within 45 cm of any enemy unit: If you score a 6 on any of these dice, then your psykers perceive the enemy’s plans — your opponent must reveal their mission. The first player to achieve their mission objective wins at the end of the Rally phase on the turn they achieve it. If both players achieve their mission objective on the same turn, or neither player has done so by the end of the 6th turn, then the battle is a draw and neither player wins. Use a standard deck of playing cards, minus the Joker cards. Shuffle, draw a card at random, and compare below to see what mission you have, and what force size it grants you. Where the force size states \"Vanguard +X%\", this means that you must choose detachments from your army that have a combined points value total of up to X% of the maximum points value limit that you agreed for this scenario. You may choose only complete detachments. Example 1. Force size You and your opponent agree a maximum points value limit of 2,000 points for this scenario. You draw a mission which allows you \"Vanguard +25%\". So, you will use your vanguard, plus any number of complete detachments you choose whose points values total no more than 500 points. 2 — Stall them Force size: Vanguard only Mission details: Slow the enemy to buy some time — form a strongpoint with your vanguard and and hold on to the last individual. To achieve your mission: At the end of the 4th turn, have at least one unit of your vanguard still in the playing area and not subject to the Broken condition. 3 — Thorn in their side Force size: Vanguard only Mission details: Deliver a sharp counter-attack to slow down the enemy, and then retreat. To achieve your mission: Destroy at least one enemy unit and make sure that you suffer no more than twice as many losses as your opponent (in terms of number of units and/or Damage Capacity lost). Retreat your vanguard units off of the table edge anywhere along your deployment zone by the end of the 4th turn. At the end of the 4th turn, any of your units that remain in the playing area are destroyed and count towards your losses. [TODO: Perhaps adjust this mission or add some suggestions. Seems like these casualty-based criteria would make some match-ups especially unbalanced — particularly when facing an enemy that has aircraft (given likely lack of anti-aircraft weapons), or when low-value/weak horde-type forces face high-value/tough elite forces (the whole point of horde armies is that they can absorb a lot more losses, but this casualty-based scoring treats all armies the same). 4 — Behind the lines Force size: Vanguard +25% Mission details: It seems like the enemy is building up to a big assault in the near future in this sector of the battle front.
